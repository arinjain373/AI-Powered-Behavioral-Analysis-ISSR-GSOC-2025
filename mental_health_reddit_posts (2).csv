Despite my efforts, I’m not getting better. I keep applying for jobs, but whenever I get hired, I struggle to function. I can’t focus, I feel nauseous, and I have trouble managing my emotions, which makes it difficult to keep working.  

I had to stop taking my medications because it was too expensive, and I simply can’t afford it. My parents are already in debt, and I don’t want to burden them further since they’re dealing with their own struggles. On top of that, I’m running out of money, and the thought of being a financial burden weighs on me even more.  

Every day, I feel incredibly heavy, like there’s a constant stabbing pain in my chest that never goes away. It’s exhausting, and no matter what I do, I can’t seem to escape it. Everything feels overwhelming, and I don’t know how much longer I can endure this. My depression feels stronger than me, constantly pulling me under no matter how hard I fight.  

I’ve tried searching for something that gives me a sense of purpose, but nothing ever feels right. No matter what I do, it doesn't get better. It feels like I’m stuck in a cycle I can’t break, and I don’t know how to move forward.

Good family, good friends, good country, good future ahead of me. It makes me feel worse about the feelings I’ve been having lately. I’ve been thinking about death, about the many, many more years I might continue living and growing on this planet, the good and the bad I will experience and wonder if any of it’s actually worth it. I look at the world and the more I do so the more it all becomes so intensely insane and draining to me. I mean what is any of this anyway? What am I? I’ve tried finding meaning through various philosophical perspectives but ultimately cant find an acceptable solution to this maddening reality, it’s all just anyone’s best guess as to what it’s all about. Most nights I consider the possibility that I might not wake up the next morning, and a strange feeling of comfort comes over me, I think I would welcome death in a way like that.

1jlk9ub,depression,2025-03-28 02:02:08,Tonight i'm going to kill myself,"My name is Gian and i'm from Peru, unfortunately the last you will hear from me is that I made a post on Reddit before ending my life.
I'm 22 years old and I study Software Engineering, the beginning of my depression started when my father started abusing me since I was 7 years old, I told my mom about it when I turned 18, if I'm honest with myself, I never made my mom proud during my whole life, it was something I always wanted to do, I'm not going to lie, I was making it or so I thought, since I started studying at my university I became more responsible, I learned to love myself more and focus on what's important.
My dad located me and beat me at the time of departure at my university, he broke my glasses.
To make matters worse, next week is my graduation, I have a failed course that I have to pay for or I won't be able to graduate as an engineer.
I'd rather slit my wrists right now than see my mom disappointed in me and have her tell me ""you're still the same irresponsible guy.""
This course is not even a course that I studied, the university forces you to look for a company and work without pay for 6 months, I couldn't get a company and now I'm screwed and without money to pay for that damn course :(
I have seen my mom cry many times and it has always broken my heart, I was always taught since I was little that a man should never cry, that doing that is faggy, for the first time in my life I am venting here, I am fucked and there is no solution for this, if you read this mom: ""I'm really sorry and i love You""

1jckrs8,depression,2025-03-16 12:52:18,Everyone's living their life and i'm vegetating.,"I am severely depressed, no family or friends. I work full time but apart from that i'm just playing video games and hoping that my life will soon end.

People from my past are all living their life. They start a family, are constantly traveling, overall broadening their horizons. I know it's not the right thing to focus on other people's life (not always reality), but it makes me so unhappy. I had a lot of dreams, aspirations.

My past and the depression took everything from me. My childhood was a living hell, during school and now in worklife i always get bullied. I always end up with abusive boyfriends (one of them r\*ped me). Friends always backstabbed or betrayed me.

I'm now at a point, where i don't trust anyone. I'm just so done with life and other humans. I cut ties to my family and the couple ""friends"" i still had. I just couldn't take it any longer.

I'm all alone now. I know this is not healthy and the right thing. But how do you continue? I always try and try and try...am hopeful. But it always ends up in failure.

I also tried a lot of therapies, but i don't believe in it any more. I focus on my medication, so that i can function and handle my life.

I didn't want this life but it seems i have to torment myself, until my time has come.

I really don't know to continue from this point on.

And i really can't hear bull like think positive, it will get better.

I really don't know how i can turn my life around.

1jfnaxe,depression,2025-03-20 12:04:17,"Functional depression, the silent killer","The title speaks for itself. This goes out to anyone who experiences this daily, including myself. This has been going on for years, you spend every single day putting your feelings and your happiness on the back burner just to be there for other people and lift them up out of any rough spot they have in their life. It’s like an addiction, you often wonder… would anyone do this for me? People ask you at work, or a casual conversation “How are you?” And all you can do is lie and say “I’m good how about you” with a fake smile on your face because you feel like nobody genuinely cares at the end of the day. It also gets to the point where you don’t want to burden or bother anyone with your problems so what’s the point of even speaking? It bottles up in your brain to the point where you think to yourself how it would feel to not be alive and experience this torture any longer. I don’t know how people make it so long, it’s often the ones you’d never expect and some of that stems from being functionally depressed. It’s a curse that can’t go away or be shaken it often feels like. If anyone else out there is going through this, I wish you the best and I pray that you make it through it. Battling depression and your mental worries on your own is so hard especially when you feel like you have nobody.

1j05na2,depression,2025-02-28 11:34:37,Please help me understand why someone in a depressive episode often pulls away from everyone they love.,"Edit: Thank you so much to everyone. I have read (and am reading) every single comment, and I am so touched that you have all let me in to your world a little bit and shared with me what this experience is like for you. You have helped me SO much to understand why a depressed person isolates and withdraws, and I can't tell you how much I appreciate this. One person said that understanding is not necessary because it's enough to know that the depressed person is in pain and that your presence doesn't make it any better - and I agree to an extent, but understanding at least a little bit helps me to have more empathy which makes it easier to bear my small portion of this sorrow, and hopefully to be a better support for my loved one.

I know this has likely been discussed a million times before, but can those of you who struggle with depression (or have a loved one who does) help me to understand why a depressed person withdraws from people they care about? I am going through this with a loved one. They cancelled a trip to come and see me, saying they were devastated about it, but they just can't. They are deep in a depressive episode. I spoke to them on the phone last night and they said they are withdrawing from everyone - family, friends - and only able to focus on work. It broke my heart to think of what they are going through, and I don't know how to help. They said they just want to be alone right now but have previously said they don't want me to abandon them and asked me to have patience. They said they will come to visit me sometime in the future, they just don't know when. I tried to talk to them but the conversation just didn't really make any sense.

1j2d6b4,depression,2025-03-03 07:19:32,Turned 40 and all I did was stay in bed.,"Congratulations to me I've lived to be a 40 year old parasite.  Im truly surprised by how I've been able to maintain such a shitty existence. I've actually been really trying to not be a piece of shit but clearly we all can't be winners. I'm beyond compromised l, I wish I had a gun😀 🔫👋


I would like to thank everyone who took the time to read and respond to my post. As someone who feels beyond loneliness, it really means a lot to me. I'm crying as I'm writing this because I truly don't feel like I'm good enough or even matter to warrant a response. Talking shit to myself has become such a habit because I'm so angry with myself for allowing myself to become who I have become, I can't even look in a mirror as my face actually can make me so angry that I want to punch the mirror. 

It's 3:21 am, I can't sleep so I thought I'd check out Reddit and was surprised by the responses. Even tho I may treat myself like absolute shit, I would never do the same to another person which I know sounds beyond fucked up but a part of me doesn't want to stop and that part of me seems to get stronger the older i get. 


I tend to look into a lot of self help topics. Even tho I'm clearly not practicing  any of them, well I have but clearly gave up. Practically read every book from atomic habits, the sublet art of not giving a fuck, how to stop worrying and start living, ect. This may come off as a bit prudish but I get a lot of advice about fitness to gain confidence. The problem, fitness is something I have always done and been obsessed with my whole life. I go regardless if I'm happy or sad but if I'm sad I literally don't give a shit about looking pissed off and clearly that's not a good look. When I'm in that mood I really couldn't care less tho

I've always been that in shape guy and the guy to talk about fitness related advice. I have never gained confidence by being fit or working out, in fact I think it's harder for me as i literally look like that fit asshole that doesn't want to talk to anyone but sometimes it comes from a place of insecurity and anxiety and other times I put on the facade to not be bothered. I am aware of the type of reputation that would get you at the gym,  I do get attention but never act on it  ruined plenty of opportunities but in a strange way it makes me want to miss them all over trying to get better and acting on said opportunities. Yup I'm fucked and bitter, at least I'm honest which itself can be a defense mechanism to keep people away. I had a girl tell me who I met on a dating app when it was clear to her that I was telling her all about my faults in which she responded, I shouldn't be so honest so fast about everything as it makes it hard for people to like me and develop relationships. Yet I haven't changed and that was 8 years ago. 

Just thought I'd give some more perspective on my situation and I feel like an anomaly.

I don’t want the obligation of living a life. I don’t want a job, I don’t want a family, I don’t want to grow old with someone, I don’t want to see the world, I don’t want to further my education, I have no goddamn desire for anything and if one more fucking person tells me that’s the depression talking I’m gonna lose it. When I say I don’t want to live a life I’m saying it in the same sense of “I don’t want to jump off of a cliff” or “I don’t want to stand up in front of that crowd” like I genuinely and simply just don’t want to do it and I don’t know why it’s so hard for people to understand what I’m trying to say. I’m not sad, more so mad I guess, mad that I have the obligation of living because some selfish women wanted to birth me and now I’m expected to contribute to society and live a “long fulfilling life” but FUCK I just don’t want to! I’ve done everything I wanted to do in life and I’m ready to be done. Why do I have to wait around for the next 60 or so years till I die.

1j2besh,depression,2025-03-03 05:21:20,the world wasn’t made for mentally ill people and i’m fucking tired of people acting like there’s some easy fix.,"therapy is mostly a sham. you sir down, talk about your feelings, and then you go home. sure, for a little while you have a weight lifted off of you — you got everything out, of course, but it’ll come back again eventually no matter how many times you try to resolve it.

it’s even worse when your trauma is like a web. there’s one thing connected to another thing that causes you to behave one way that effects another thing. how long would it take to untangle it all? i don’t know. 

meds are a sham too. i was on antipsychotics from 12 to when i turned 17 and i could feel my brain melting. i used to dissociate a lot, but now it feels like i’m in a constant fog even worse than anything ever before. i’m incapable.

the worst part is that nobody will give you grace. they expect you to live up to their plans, their expectations, to what they want from you without any regard for what you want or what your going through. a counselor won’t try to understand, nor a parent, nor a friend, nor an employer, nor the entire world.

i don’t really see a point in engaging in the world or “playing the game”. it was rigged against me. i owe the world nothing. i don’t want success. i don’t want money. i want my suffering and struggle to mean something. i wish i could be like a knight in a dark fantasy game, have it all amount to some absurd final climax or ovjective",226,21,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1j2besh/the_world_wasnt_made_for_mentally_ill_people_and/,world wasnt made mentally ill people im fucking tired people acting like theres easy fix therapy mostly sham sir talk feelings go home sure little weight lifted got everything course itll come back eventually matter many times try resolve even worse trauma like web theres one thing connected another thing causes behave one way effects another thing long would take untangle dont know meds sham antipsychotics 12 turned 17 could feel brain melting used dissociate lot feels like im constant fog even worse anything ever im incapable worst part nobody give grace expect live plans expectations want without regard want going counselor wont try understand parent friend employer entire world dont really see point engaging world playing game rigged owe world nothing dont want success dont want money want suffering struggle mean something wish could like knight dark fantasy game amount absurd final climax ovjective

My future is more than bleak and I don’t see anything good for myself. Bad luck seems to follow me wherever I go. I am not going to start listing all my problems here but I’m just so fucking done. This life is so meaningless and I don’t see a point anymore. I’d rather be dead than have to live everyday in this earth. I envy people at war torn areas because if I were them, I would just walk straight to my death and at least it would be easier because I don’t want to take my life away, I want it to happen to me.

And worse of all, I live relatively comfortable life. Roof over my head, temporary stable income (I’m getting laid off soon and can’t find a job). I live in a good country and I’m young and healthy. The guilt of living a good life and still feeling miserable makes it 100x worse. My problems may seem superficial to some but to me it’s my whole life. I try to be grateful for everything I have but it gets to hard and difficult when other things don’t go well in your life. Everyone keeps telling me “it will get better” and “be more grateful and focus on the positives” but honestly this is such fucking bullshit. It doesn’t get better. I don’t know what else to do. I tried getting closer to God, didn’t help. Now I don’t even know if I believe anymore. I’m losing my sense of self and my will to be a functioning human and I hate it so much to the point that I find comfort in death.

I have isolated myself for the past year after falling into a deep depressive episode after one panic attack, and i have become a completely different person. I lost my job, and basically just sit on my ass playing video games and sleeping as much as possible hoping i don’t wake up. 

The worst part of this is the cognitive changes and the loneliness. I go days without even hearing another souls voice, and my memory and thinking ability is so impaired i can’t remember what i had for dinner yesterday and my mind is completely void of thought 24/7

Whenever i have tried to talk to people, i just can’t because i can’t think anymore and my personality is just gone. i don’t even talk to my parents anymore. i’m just like a zombie. I feel like my life is being wasted and i could have never imagined that life could get this bad.

I am scared to even step outside of my house anymore. Doctors have found nothing wrong with my brain and therapy/ medication has not worked. I think of suicide every day, any advice or encouragement would be appreciated because i am truly on the edge of life and death.

I’m terrified I might not graduate because I’ve missed so much schoolwork that I still need to make up. I really am trying but a lot or the time it feels like it’s for nothing. I don’t have the motivation or aspirations I used to have anymore. When I think about doing schoolwork I get a guilty pit in my stomach and can’t bring myself to do it. Sometimes I wonder if something really is wrong with me or if I’m just lazy.

What would you do in my situation? I just want to get out of this funk I’ve been in the last 3 years and live a normal life like my peers but it feels unobtainable at this point.

1jjlsz2,depression,2025-03-25 15:18:19,Guilty. Depressed. Suicidal.,"I'm a 21yo F, pretty good position in life otherwise. Studying to become a doctor. Not struggling academically. 

But adulthood hit me like a bomb. Since 3 years I've been through depressing times. Everything I do brings me guilt.

The thought of having my parents talk to me on call? Why'd they want to?

The eye contact with anyone? Oh shit I'm so sorry you had to see my face. 

Eating food? Do I even deserve this?

Asking for help when suicidal? Nobody deserves to hear this depressing stuff. Reddit is anonymous and helps me keep venting the pressure off and not blasting away.

I've still managed pass 3 years of my med school pretty much normally except the year 1 when I just couldn't understand what was happening. I asked for help back then. Idk if I got help or got scammed. I've probably taken every antidepressant in the books and my body is too sensitive to handle any of those side effects. I've been admitted so many times against my wishes. I've been through the horrors of ECTs against my will. Not 1 not 2 but 18 sessions. Since then I've had to pretend everything was more than normal and I was a very happy excellently performing student coping up with every damn thing. 

Today has been hard. Haven't been out of bed since like 8 hours. 2 days feeling like my breathing is so laboured. Anxiety shooting through the roof feeling like someone's about to take everything away from me. And obviously so much dissociation, I don't even feel alive and need to do anything to die. I already feel dead ngl. Idk why I'm writing this. Idk what to do. Idk what is about to come. Everything just needs to stop.

1jcruih,depression,2025-03-16 18:17:51,"I have the ""wrong"" type of depression","SSRIs didn't do shit. Nor mirtazapine. Nor CBT. Nor counselling. Nor even stimulants now.

I genuinely despise the words ""attitude"" and ""mindset"" and wish to see them permanently expunged from the English vocabulary. Incidentally, none of the counsellors or therapists I've seen over the years have used those two words with me. It's only people who explicitly *aren't* healthcare professionals who say those words within my earshot. I wonder why that is.

I legitimately wonder if I have a neurological disorder that better explains why I'm so passive and avoidant, because others who apparently have depression seemingly do not understand, at least not anymore. Not that I'd expect to be taken seriously by healthcare professionals if I were to ask.

I guess I'm not the relatively acceptable type of depressed where I'm ""resilient"" enough or whatever to still take care of myself and live independently. ""Okay, *I* am depressed, *I* hate myself, but at least I brush my teeth/go outside/drink water/eat actual meals, you have no excuse"" - okay, congratulations. Cool. I don't know what you expect me to do with this information. Hearing it has increased the concentrations of dopamine, serotonin, and whatever ""willpower"" is in my brain by an astounding 0.000000000%. It may well have further depleted them, if anything.

Then there's the idea that if I ""hit rock bottom"" I'll magically improve because I ""have to."" I doubt it. If I were on the brink of homelessness, that wouldn't magically make me employable, or make me successfully get a job. I'd just be homeless. It doesn't work out for everyone like that. Just world fallacy, and so on.

I can understand how the always living have been deluded into thinking that we ""want"" or ""choose"" to be the way. But I genuinely do not understand how people more functional than me, who claim to have once been as nonfunctional as me, who apparently have/had depression, also delude themselves into thinking that those who didn't survive with them, who didn't get to go with them, only didn't do so because they ""chose"" or ""wanted"" to stay behind.

Explain to me why I would ""choose"" this and how exactly I benefit from feeling as though my hair is composed of straw and my brain holds seemingly as much value as a raisin.

1jisfpe,depression,2025-03-24 14:49:14,Knowing That Suicide Is In My Hands Brings Me Peace,"For as long as I can remember, life has been an uphill battle. I’ve tried so hard, I’ve pushed myself further than I ever thought possible. But despite all the effort, everything still feels like it’s slipping away. **I feel like I’m cursed.** No matter what I do, no matter how much strength I muster, nothing changes. I don’t know if I can keep going on like this.

The only thing that seems to give me some sort of peace is knowing that I have control. **I can make the choice.** I know that suicide is in my hands, and that fact, strangely, brings me a twisted sense of comfort. The thought that I’m not powerless, that I still have some control over my fate, gives me something to hold onto. Even if everything else feels out of control, at least this one thing is mine.

But here’s the truth that I try not to think about: I’m so tired. I’m exhausted from pretending, from holding it all together. Sometimes, I don’t even want to be strong anymore. I just want the weight to lift, even if just for a moment.

I don’t want anyone to feel sorry for me, and I don’t want pity. I just want someone to understand. I want someone to know how hard it is to keep going when it feels like the world is against you. And if someone can’t understand, at least I wish they could acknowledge the pain that never seems to end.

1j0h3pc,depression,2025-02-28 20:13:47,I don't wanna go blind,"

I'm a 25 years old man. Few months ago i was diagnosed with advanced glaucoma. Apparently i've had it for years but i never noticed until i've lost a significant amount of vision(mainly peripheral vision). The doctors said that they're doing their best to slow down the blindness but i'll eventually become.completely blind in few years. 

I'm feeling sad, depressed, angry and scared. It's a very hard to put into words what i'm feeling right now. I don't feel like i'm just losing my vision, i feel like i'm losing my potential, my dreams and even my identity. 

I love coding and i've always wanted to be a software engineer one day but with how things are going now it feels almost impossible to achieve. I feel like giving up on it now.

Another problem is that all my hobbies include sight, video games, animes and manga, tv shows and movies, reading books, football and chess. I tried to play a game few days ago but i couldn't. If i focus on my character i can't see the map or my health bar. If i focus on the map i can't see my character. It's like the informations slowly becoming something i couldn't parse. It was the first time i was like ""Ooh fuck i'm really going blind !!"".  It's a big hit and felt like a painful stab in my heart.

My family is supportive but i can see the pain they are feeling. I can't help but feel bitter and angry. Sometimes i wonder if i'm being punished for a major flaw in my character. 



One day you are the funny reliable friend that people seek for advice and someday you are the pitied friend who lost his sight. One day you are the cool uncle who plays video games with his nieces or help them with their math homework and someday you will be the poor uncle who struggles doing basic tasks like going to the toilet or trimming his nails.

I don't wanna be a burden, i don't wanna make life difficult for those around me.  I don't wanna be dependant on others to do most things. I just wanna be ME.
 
The most painful part of it all is the realization that someday i won't be able to see the people i love, their faces, their laughs, the new clothes they bought, or even watching football or enjoying a video game together. One day all of this will be gone. My life will be different, i will be different, everything will be different. It's like I clicked a reset button.

I tried to accept it but for each new blind spot in my vision i get sad, depressed and feel like i'm losing part of me. 

I feel like giving up on everything, and tbh if i wasn't religious i would've ended it really.

We don't get friends easily either. Which is why she used me as her emotional punching back and manipulated me. If i don't like it, i can always fuck off to my basement. And she will come off looking like the good guy since she had her gal pals to validate her that it's guys like me whonare trash. Guys like me just aren't good enough.

1jmb67i,depression,2025-03-29 01:25:21,I hate being alive.,"I could tell you a thousand reasons as to why the world is a terrible place - wars, global warming, awful people, violence. And then you would say something like ""yes, but there are good things, like..."" or ""well, life is about trying to be good and left the world better"". But I don't want to live not because of all of those reasons, but because I just hate being alive. I don't hate myself, I don't hate my life in particular, I just hate that I'm alive.

My life is not bad. I have a roof over my head, I have a friend, a dog, I kinda have a job. I'm finishing a degree, but if it wasn't for my parents, I wouldn't do that. I chose this course because I didn't know what to do with my life and it seemed easy. Nothing interests me, even if I ""liked"" something in the past, it was just temporary. I do see beauty in things, I can experience a moment of joy. But it doesn't matter to me, as it hurts in some weird way. I feel like I'm constantly saying goodbye to something and someone. Like I'm giving everything away and leaving everything behind, like people before commiting suicide tend to do.
 
Someone could offer me a billion dollars, unlimited free travels, a good job, a beautiful house or a perfect partner, and I would decline, because I just don't want to experience life. In any way, good or bad. Everything I own could've been took away and I would just accept that.
 
Everyone's like ""follow your dreams"", ""think about what you want the most and live to achieve that"", but I don't want to. I don't want anything. I think I've always been this way, since I was a child. I think my purpose is to kill myself. I have some money to leave for my parents to not cause a problem in organizing my funeral. In the past, I wanted to leave letters to a few people, thanking them, explaining some things, apologizing. But now I would only leave a one note, explaining that no one should blame themselves or think that they could've do more for me.

1jg2eil,depression,2025-03-20 23:04:04,I wish I was aborted.,"I know I was a mistake. The product of some anniversary sex and that's it. My parents make it abundantly clear to me that this is what my life is. 

I was born premature, my mother makes it clear that she wishes they didn't do CPR on me when I was removed from her womb. I know she wishes I was dead.

My siblings are 8-10 years older than me. One hates me and one probably hates me, even if she pretends to like me. 

When I look to the future I try my very hardest to envision a life for myself and I don't. I try my very hardest and I just can't seem to do it.  

I don't see any point in living, in fact - objectively everyone's life would be better without me. And that's not the depression talking. 

Sure, maybe a handful (even that's generous) of people would miss me - but even that would be temporary in nature. 

I spend lunches at school alone, every conversation I have seems superficial. And the short conversations I have outside of school are probably the peak of my social interaction. 

There isn't anything here for me on earth, just pain, misery and loneliness. 

I genuinely, from the bottom of my heart, wish I was aborted.

1j5brrw,depression,2025-03-07 01:22:05,I don’t know how to tell my parents.,"I’m 19, my birthday is coming up soon, and I’ve been in the same situation for about 6-7 years. no friends, no social life.. blah blah blah…

Not having these things are what gave me depression, and now depression is what’s stoping me from getting these things. 

Now.. the issue is that I’m not diagnosed, so I can’t get any treatment.

I also don’t have my license, and there’s nobody I can get to take me (no friends, remember?)… other than my parents. 

My parents are great, nothing wrong with them, they would 100% understand. But I genuinely don’t know how to approach this. For literal years, I’ve gone over how I could tell them that I’m depressed, and that I need help. And for some silly reason, I start to tear up, just thinking about it.

I’m not necessarily afraid of them seeing me cry, but I really don’t think I could handle breaking down in front of my parents, about how depressed I am, and how much I’ve been suffering for all these years. It almost seems like it’s just.. a lot of bottled up emotion? I mean, I’ve never told anyone how I feel. And like.. I can’t even think about telling anyone without tearing up.

(The thing I fear the most is that they’ll feel really bad for me, and treat me differently. I don’t want to be seen as a poor, sad, little boy. Even if that’s kind of what I am right now lmao)

One thing is for sure, though. I can’t keep living like this. My depression is at an all time high, and it’s getting worse every day. My parents know something is wrong now, my room is… insanely messy (huge understatement), my hygiene is at its worst, and I feel like doing nothing.

I know they think I’m just lazy, because they keep asking me why I don’t clean my room, why I don’t clean up after myself, why I don’t come out of my room, why I don’t talk anymore.. my dad just asked me if he’s doing something wrong, (on the phone) and it just made me tear up. I’m making their life harder, too, at this point.

So! I’d like advice, or somthing. I don’t really know. I feel pretty silly about this, I think it’s kind of dumb.

I’ve wanted kids my entire life up until the last few years where my mental health has been spiraling. It would be cruel to bring a kid into this world where I am their mother. It hurts a whole lot to admit this but it would be a lot better that way.

 I have a few mental health disorders that could ruin my own life if I let them so I would never want to put myself in the position of a full time caregiver and especially not a nutrients source. I understand how much a kid can really take out of someone and I’ve realized that I’m not in the right state of mind for that. 

 My sister just had a kid and she’s always been the favorite so of course her first grandchild from will also be the favorite. It stemmed from thought of being completely alone if I have a baby. I don’t do relationships because I’m not cut out for them. I’m taking every precaution to make sure I don’t have a baby. Especially since I don’t see myself with anyone in the future. 

  I don’t want a child to feel how I felt growing up. I know I would do the best I could but I could not fathom the thought of ruining a child’s life because I messed up. It was a hard decision to make but I need to do what’s best. No one in my family knows how I feel about this topic because it’s always “when are you giving me a great grandbaby?” From both of my grandmothers.. or whatever family members want to ask me when I’m going to have a baby.

1j2ucr4,anxiety,2025-03-03 21:44:08,I think I'm going into psychosis.,"I think I'm developing psychosis

This doesn't feel like anxiety or OCD. I feel like I'm going to lose control of my mind completely and/or end up in the psych ward. I'm a 23 yo female, no family history of schizophrenia, but lately I've had: 

• Intense escalation of anxiety and OCD symptoms, which I'm terrified is the prodromal phase of schizophrenia. 
• A feeling of being ""disconnected"", almost like I'm experiencing derealization (which I've had before), but only like, 10%. Everything sort of just feels ""off"". 
•A creepy/eerie feeling, like the feeling you get after watching a horror movie or waking up from a nightmare. 
• I have to avoid anything to do with death/mental illness/dark or disturbing content (books, movies, tv shows, etc) because it gives me extreme anxiety and feelings of impending doom. 
• Intense brain fog, almost like there's a dark cloud over my mind and I'm unable to rationalize or think straight. 
• Feeling like I'm unable to comprehend time, or like it has no meaning. Like time is ""sped up"" or I'm in a dream for the majority of the day. 
• My thoughts feel extremely jumbled at night, and like I don't have control over them. I've also been having hypnogogic (sp?) hallucinations and extremely vivid disturbing nightmares. 
• Seeing shadows pass over my eye lids while my eyes are closed. 
• Also, insomnia and waking up at night with extreme anxiety and feeling ""out of control"", like something terrible is about to happen. No physical symptoms, it's all in my head. 😞 
• Crazy intrusive thoughts, like maybe my family is not real, my life is not real, I'm dreaming, etc. 

I'm certain I'm going into psychosis because of these symptoms. Even worse, during the brief periods I'm not fixated on these symptoms, I'm convinced it's because I'm ""losing insight"". I've been in a severe anxiety and OCD flare up for the last two months, and I'm convinced it was either prodromal schizophrenia OR now I have stress induced psychosis. I'm so fixated on everything I'm thinking and feeling. I'm literally about to cry.

1jl1ib0,anxiety,2025-03-27 11:16:42,Reminder to be careful with benzodiazepines.,"I'm not demonizing benzos or people who take them at all. I still safely take Xanax once or twice a week and it's extremely helpful for my panic attacks or just any type of severe anxiety I'm going through.  

I just wanted to remind everyone to be careful. I feel like some doctors aren't clear enough on how often you should usually take them if it's a permanent med you want to have in your life to take occasionally and ""as needed"". My doctor basically told me nothing when prescribing me Xanax as a teenager and it didn't go well because I used it everyday. It was complete HELL getting off of it.  

Long term consistent and everyday use can eventually cause addiction/dependency which is seriously one of the worst feelings in the world especially the withdrawal that can come with it. Severe withdrawal that happens from being dependent on larger doses can even be dangerous. 

Be sure to ask your doctor any questions you have before starting them. Like I said before I'm not trying to demonize benzos or anyone who takes them. Not looking to scare anyone either I just don’t want anyone to go through what I did as a teenager when I didn't know much about the topic before it was too late. 

Benzodiazepines can be an amazingly helpful tool and medication when used the right way. Just be careful friends that is all.

We do pretty good about knowing his triggers, and working through it when he’s feeling anxious or having an anxiety attack. This past week when’s woken up in the middle of the night to pee he’s needed to wake me up as he says he just feels scared. He’ll go to the bathroom and come lay back down and go back to sleep. He says he doesn’t know why he feels scared he just does but having me awake with him helps. Until this week he hadn’t done this in about 17 years when his anxiety was at its worst. It just kind of stopped on its own then but I’m curious if anyone experienced this before. 

He doesn’t like/won’t take meds and really doesn’t want to even talk to a Doctor as he feels embarrassed talking to anyone about me. I love him to death and I’m 100% fine with him waking me up if he needs me. 

So I guess not much point to this I guess other than seeing if anyone has gone through this.

1jfch4c,anxiety,2025-03-20 00:34:38,I feel like my anxiety is going to kill me and I've been having panic attacks for days straight.,"**Long story:** Mid January I went to the ER because I abruptly woke up out of sleep with a huge sense of impending doom, rapid heart rate, insane stomach bloating and feeling like I had to poop. I wasn't sure if I was going to die or having a heart attack. I had an elevated d-dimer and TSH of 50, chest CT scan revealed nothing, EKG showed tachycardia and possible left atrial enlargement (doctor did not seem concerned about this).

Discharged with anxiety, the week after this visit I barely ate anything, had insomnia, and got severe depersonalization where I just did not feel real anymore. Fuzzy head, nausea, I just could not function properly. I have always had episodes of panic and anxiety, but nothing this severe. I was prescribed levothyroxine for my hypothyroidism (I stopped taking it and this ER visit prompted me to re take it).

This experience with panic attacks spurred me to seek a therapist and since then I've been battling with just a heightened sense of anxiety and doom. I started developing a deep depression and nocturnal panic attacks became more frequent. Several nights I would wake up feeling like I was dying, but I tried to focus on my symptoms and calm myself down. However, this has created a situation during the day where I felt sleepy, extreme anxiety, and a fear of going anywhere really on my own because I am afraid of dying.

Last Friday, I had a severe wave of panic again with a rapid heart rate. Again, I thought I was going to die but I tried to work through it. However, it just felt like those feelings of panic became...prolonged. The next day, I tried waking up and going about my day, and I just got this sense that something was off. I went to the ER again, this time with chest pain, dizziness, and sense of doom as my symptoms. I had a mental breakdown there. My EKG again said possible left atrial enlargement again but my heart rate was fine and my labs came back normal (slightly low WBC, high protein). A therapist came and spoke with me and we agreed to inpatient therapy, however, after they took away all my belongings I started to panic even more and decided it wasn't for me.

Sense that visit, I cannot relax. I feel like death is on my horizon. I will admit that this feels like the first time I am coming to terms with my mortality and it's scaring the hell out of me and making me super sad. I love life, and I want to live it, but I am stuck in a mental rumination cycle where I genuinely feel like something is very off and I am going to die or drop dead at any moment. The visceral experience of panic attacks and feeling like I am dying is making me so depressed.

My mind says ""this is it, you're going to die"" several times a day, or I have visions of my dead body on the floor. Sometimes I don't feel real or alive and feel very confused when I wake up. I fear that I am going to have a heart attack, or a brain aneurysm, or just die in my sleep. It's like there's a medical emergency looming around the corner and I can't seem to shake the feeling. Any slight sense of pain or pressure anywhere in my body I start freaking out. I have also thought that I could have a tumor that is secreting cortisol and causing waves of intense panic (I am a hypochondriac).

I actually feel like I am going mentally insane. I don't feel safe anymore, and the past couple days I have had some more ""positive moments"" but the darkness keeps creeping in and it's really scaring me. I am so terrified to sleep because I now have a strong association with sleep and death. I am so beyond exhausted I feel like I had the flu. I scheduled an urgent appointment with my doctor, who prescribed me meds for bloating and an antihistamine for sleeping and anxiety, but I can't bring myself to take them because I'm afraid I will have an allergic reaction or it will make it worse.

I sought urgent mental health care today and learned some techniques to calm down but I still just have this anxious feeling I can't shake and I keep wanting to go to the ER to feel safe, but I also want to avoid it also because it's triggering me.

FYI-I recently moved to a rural area where there is a lack of medical care and I have been feeling very isolated, I have to drive 20 minutes to the nearest hospital. More anxiety :)

Any advice or thoughts would be so appreciated as I am constantly living on edge and genuinely feel like I'm losing my mind and that the stress of all of this will actually kill me. Does this sound like just anxiety? Could there be something medically wrong with me that is making me feel this way? Am I just making myself so sick with the thought of my own mortality?

**UPDATE:** Thank you to everyone for your kind and insightful comments, I am wishing each and every one of you the best. I think I have for the first time in my life come to terms with my own mortality and am also grieving many, many things I never really had the chance to. It is a tumultuous time for me and I developed not only a panic disorder but an intense fear of death and nothingness. The panic attacks have subsided a bit the more I try to learn about them and accept them and I hope to get to a point where I can continue to live my life without being in constant fear.

1j22fog,anxiety,2025-03-02 21:48:05,If you’re young and have health anxiety read this.,"I just thought I’d share some interesting statistics with everyone here, which really helped my health anxiety. 

If you’re under 25 and think you’re going to have a heart attack. Incidence rates of heart attacks for this age are 1 in 50,000.
Meaning you have exactly a 0.002% chance of having a heart attack. And in most cases heart attacks in young people are caused by a pre diagnosed heart problem at birth or some sort of physical trauma like being stabbed or having a bad car crash. 

Also I’m sure you see on the news or internet about cancer statistics rising and especially in younger people. Well, let me tell you over the last 20 years they increased by 3 more cases per 100,000 people, yes 3. In 20 years. 

Furthermore if you live in the uk (most countries are similar so still applies) approximately 3750 new cancer cases are under 25s not only does this account for only 1% of all cases across the uk. It means 3750 people out of 7,590,000 are diagnosed under 25, and that’s if you assume under 25s make up only 10% of the population, my point being it’s more likely 15 or 20% of the population, making the chance even lower. To put this into a percentage this means that your exact chance of getting cancer under 25 is 0.019%. This is the exact statistic from ‘cancer research uk’ stating that 19.2 per 100,000 under 25s got cancer in the last year. Which also works out to be about 1 in 5,000, to give even more piece of mind. 


And the 1 in 2 statistic is not only questionable with its accuracy, but assuming it is accurate this is out of your entire lifetime. Not right now. And you have to account for all of the non aggressive easily treatable cancers which people can get cured from with no problem. That definitely skews the statistic and brings numbers up. So if it’s 0.019% if your under 25 right now and doesn’t really get higher until your in your 60 and 70s then stop worrying right now.

1j3wjlo,anxiety,2025-03-05 06:05:56,"Fighting 8 years with anxiety disorder, I want to list 5 helpful tips to everyone.","I'm from China, and living in USA. 
I got anxiety disorder 8 years ago when, been to ER many times. Gap 1 year from college. Now, I'm almost finishing my Ph.D. I'm having tons of pressure and stress now from marriage, job, research, and economy. 
During this 8 years, i have experience at least 30 symptoms. Still taking med now, still have a few symptoms since life is stressful.

I want to list 5 major tips that remind me all the time, and give me hope. 
!!! i have read so many research papers regarding to anxiety disorder i only believe data and statistics!!!


1. Neuroplasticity: comparing to many psychiatry disorders, anxiety mainly caused not by Gene or pathological issues, it caused mainly related to environments, wrong consumption, and bad self-awareness, which cause brain chemical functions disorder, and tons of study found that this disorder is treatable, manageable, and controllable. So, believe or not, you can be better and even curable (really!!!)

2. Therapy: I have never taken any therapy during 7 years because I don't believe it. In the 8th year, I got some bad symptoms, I started to practice with therapist about CBT and ACT. It's not useful for a period of time, but I keep practicing, focusing very hard, then I feel much happy and peaceful more and more time. I start to think differently, I'm still working on it, it's hard, but it's useful. 

3. Exercise + weight control: tons of study prove that BMI or exercise can influence your brain function. No matter what, please eat healthier and exercise more. Do not focus on whether it is helpful or not, just do it, it is beneficial. Tooooo many studies prove this. 

4. Never give up: do not lose your hope, please. I'm forcing me be positive! I start to practice my thought, focus on what I should do. If it's my last day, I need to do something to prove I have been to the world. You are fighting for yourself, and you can manage your anxiety disorder. Just keep trying and keep trying. Do not be hurry, remember, getting better always need time. Anxiety disorder can be tricky, but I have seen a lot of people getting better, and there are tons of successful cases. 

5. Comprehensive change: i have talked to many experts in China and in USA, and got one answer. 
Do not rely on therapy solely, med solely, or anything solely. Rely on everything together. I know a lot of people think med make them much better, but remember, med can only help your symptoms, you need to find the root of anxiety disorder, and change it, Forever. 


Lastly. I want to say, although China is not that poor country, still i found many people live with 300 or 400 US dollar per month in China. They even don't have money to buy meds, and a lot of them have anxiety and depression disorders. And China has very low tolerance for those psychiatry disorders. 

I know many of you don't like what I'm going to say, but in the developed country, we really have many many more opportunities and chances to fight with anxiety disorder. 

Please believe, Anxiety will always be with us, but anxiety disorder can be cured. 
Believe science and technology, not our negative thought.

1jjhjn5,anxiety,2025-03-25 11:53:38,Does anyone else feel incapable for a normal adult life and wants to die so they don’t have to face it?,"Just what the title says.

I grew up quite confident. Never had anxiety issues or something. I was only ever insecure about my looks and had some abandonement and attachment issues but that never affected anything but my romantic relationships. Doesn’t really matter for the story.

Then, when I was 21 I got IBS out of nowhere and my life just went straight to hell. Failed year after year of uni, was too afraid to go outside at one point, got severly depressed and anxious. 

I managed to get my degree and managed to land a job I like that’s also hybrid. And I still feel like wanting to die everyday because the anxiety of leaving the house and going to work is too much. I worry all the time. I worry that my IBS will act up at work, I worry I’ll get fired for using more days WFH than what we are contractually allowed. I talked to my managers about my issue and they said that it’s no problem if I need more days from home some weeks, but that didn’t lessen my anxiety.

I’ve achieved exactly nothing in my life and my every day is a battle with anxiety from the moment I wake up. I lash out at people who love me because I feel like a trapped animal only the trap is my body so I can never get away from it. I feel like such a burden on my mom, who gave me everything she could only to have to listen to me say on daily basis that my life is just one big struggle and I’m not happy and want to be dead. 

If I stay alive, I’ll just burden and wear out all people who love me. They are so worried and I am so mean. I keep telling them that more time with them is no longer enough for me to deal with life and that I want to rest. I keep thinking I’ll never be fully independant let alone be able to actually take care of someone else. Of my parents, when they get old, of a child some day… I can’t take care of myself… 

I just want to end it because I feel like I’m doing all I can to be a functioning adult and still failing miserably. 

I’m in therapy, it’s not helping. I tried meds, they do help, but not longterm and they make me sleep all the time and gain weight. I tried journalling, I have multiple hobbies, I try, I try, I try. And my life still seems reduced to anxiety of getting out of the house… I’m so tried and I feel so guilty for being like this. 
I know no one wants to lose the person they love, but I often feel that if I killed myself, my family, my friends, my partner, they would lose me once and mourn me. Like this, they are losing me everyday, all the while having to put up with me being angry at them, at my body, at my life, at everything.

You know what made me feel a little better? Wanting to die. I used to think ""why bother if I choke right now? I don't want to live anyway."" And this thought comforted me somehow and made me feel more brave to keep eating. A little after I was finally able to eat everything again.

She feels like she can't breathe, her legs feel like they want to give out and she says she feels like she ""just needs to get out"" as fast as she can.  Takes her a long while to calm down.

She doesn't feel like it is the water temp.  She keeps it on a cool, comfortable setting.  She doesn't feel like it is claustrophobia because she is fine in the bathroom any other time.  She says she hasn't had any bad experience in the shower (falls, injuries...).  She's tried putting up a curtain in the doorway and leaving the door itself open.  That didn't help.  There is an exhaust fan to control humidity so I don't that that is the issue.  

She hasn't always had this problem.  This is a newer experience that has come up over the past several months. We just can't seem to figure out what could be triggering this.

Now, I have been experiencing all the symptoms of anemia for 2 months now, which coincidentally are also symptoms for heart disease. The most concerning of these symptoms started a week ago, when I began constantly freezing and my lips, fingertips and toes kept going numb and have been slowly turning blue.

I was praying so bad for this to just be anemia, but then I got the call yesterday. My blood test results came back. They found nothing. Nothing at all. Everything was okay.

So, it's not anemia. But what else besides anemia causes cyanosis? Well, heart disease. 

I have an appointment later in the day to get it checked out, but gods I cannot stop panicking. I feel like my heart is about to explode. I cannot cope.

1jjfkck,anxiety,2025-03-25 09:41:58,"Quit alcohol, quit caffeine, quit weed. Haven’t felt this bad in years.","Edit: i do not believe i am suffering withdrawals, i believe i am struggling with the absence of dopamine.

Hi everyone. 
Mid December i decided to quit weed, a week later i decided to quit alcohol and caffeine too. I almost immediately noticed a loss of interest towards my hobbies. 

Ever since then it’s been a living hell. Up until February i was having bad panic attacks, i worked on those with a therapist and i’m now doing much better under that aspect. 

What hasn’t changed, and has worsened honestly, is the complete disinterest i have developed for all of my hobbies and life in general. The most i do is go to work, force myself to go work out, and sit on the couch with my gf, then go to sleep. 

I have lost all interest in editing photos, in taking photos, in posting them, in going to events where i can take them. I lost all interest in going out with my friends and acquaintances. I just feel so empty and unmotivated. I believed it was winter doing its thing, but the seasons are changing and my situation is mostly the same. I have even lost interest in sex. I am eating the same two foods for every meal. I don’t even find enjoyment in playing on my pc anymore, i bought myself a brand new pc for Christmas and have used it a few hours at most. I spent more time setting it up and building it vs the time i actually used it. 

I am getting tired of living like this, but i just feel so unmotivated to do anything, i lost all my drive and i’m just waiting to be better, waiting for the physical pains to go away, waiting for my mind to stop being so on edge. 

I miss my old self and have no idea how to get it back. I miss driving for hours to go to events and take photos there, i miss the late nights with friends, i miss being able to just go to a restaurant on my own and enjoy myself, i miss going out with my girlfriend and living our lives. I miss the person i was a few months ago, i feel like i’m just a shell of my old self, as if i’m running on power saving mode. And it only makes everything worse. 

Please share some advice if you can. I don’t know where i’m headed. 

Edit to add: I quit in order to become healthier, not because i had problems regulating myself. I'd smoke weed in the evening before bed (3/4 puffs) and on sunday morning (a bit more). As for alcohol, i was drinking to the point of being drunk once per month, tipsy twice per month. With the occasional beer here and there.

1jlcvuo,anxiety,2025-03-27 20:33:13,Why the fuck am I so sensitive to every single medication? Doctors don’t even believe me.,"I was prescribed the starting dose of 25 mg of hydroxyzine. Because I know better, I crush it and swallow about a fifth of it. 5 mg. That’s all I can take and I wake up the next day 12 hours later with swollen eyes. I am a zombie. I tried this for one week. It’s 1: hours after I took the bit last night and my mouth is still so dry I feel sick.

The same thing happens with my medication for bipolar, Depakote and lamotrigine. My doctors do not believe me when I tell them how insanely sluggish it makes me, I’ve been cutting the starting pills into half for years now and am very stable mood/wise with that. I am unable to increase like my doctors insist for no good reason.

I sleep with a CPAP every night, because for as long as I can remember after a brain surgery in high school, I am stuck hyperventilating and forget to breathe until I remind myself. The anxiety medication makes me breathe better I see on my charts, but at what cost? I can’t function like this during the day.

I had DPDR for many years due to my first incident with weed. This ruined me once and for all. I get panic attacks if I see someone 20 feet away from me smoking it. I tried drinking a very small amount of Kava for anxiety, which threw me into a panic episode of depersonalization. 

The only thing that has ever helped me was alcohol. And that’s that. There is really nothing else that comes close for me. Unless anyone else has any ideas. I am very afraid of most medications, but any ideas would be of help.

He admitted to me that he smoked weed after I admitted I do it myself, but he again made it weird… like he told me why he stopped recently, ""a spiritual awakening"" he called it. He told me why he initially started smoking, and he said it was because he couldn't stand his wife or kids anymore, and they were close to a divorce. Right before our session ended he said “go on a walk and write five things you find beautiful, besides yourself, and tell me why.” I guess I'm just wondering if my gut is right? Or is this just how therapy works? I can’t tell if it’s my anxiety or if these are actual red flags.

Now one cup of coffee gives me uncomfortable anxiety. Caffeine used to fuel my vacations, but on my last trip to Europe in October 2024, I couldn't handle *one* cup in the morning. I was fine on my trip in 2023, in contrast.

My tolerance doesn't appear to be going back to normal either. I have switched to Green Tea. I suspect the anxiety is related to the cummulative damage to my digestive system. I have bad acid reflux and can't handle red meat or beer any longer either. My body just reads the stimulant as a threat.

Its strange watching people in their 70's drinking multiple cups of coffee, like it's nothing. I can't even handle one cup. 

I'm just curious if others have had a similar experience and whether they somehow got over it (I'm not optimistic).

1j8sia2,anxiety,2025-03-11 14:49:30,Anyone else experiencing ergophobia? (fear of work),"I just found out that my fear of work is called ergophobia.
I’ve been dealing with anxiety my whole life: scared to go to school, to uni, now I’m struggling with keeping up with my job. 
I’m not sure if something in my childhood caused this, but just thinking of how people might perceive me at work, if I do something wrong, if I ask stupid questions - makes me panic to the point I feel paralysed. 
The funny part is that I consider myself pretty smart and capable, but anxiety makes me fail at almost everything I do, I tend to avoid things that seem difficult and might cause any inconvenience. 
I work as a project manager, it’s been almost 3 years now. 
As an introverted person I find this position already hard enough and not very suitable. But when I first got the offer it was the best day of my life. I’m shocked that I’ve somehow managed to keep this job and pretend I’m good at this. 
Every email distresses me so much, I’m scared to start the day, because I have no idea what to expect and how to act, I overthink and end up replying something stupid. Usually, before replying to emails I compose a draft and send it to myself several times, trying to build different scenarios, now I’ve started to do the same with simple work chat messages (even if my reply is just one word). I know this is crazy and I have no idea how to fix my brain. 
It’s exhausting and started to affect my mental health severely. 
I’m thinking of leaving this place, but that would be another proof of my avoidant behaviour which I find embarrassing. That would mean I’m weak and gave up once again instead of pushing through. 
I’m looking for job offers now but pretty sure no matter the job I’ll feel the same everywhere. It wouldn’t be a brand new start and I won’t act differently. 
I’m lost and it makes me feel suicidal. 
I have history of suicidal thoughts and attempts, I was diagnosed with depression, bulimia and anxiety disorder, but you can’t really get any good help in my country. I’m trying to handle things myself and it’s not going good obviously. I don’t want to harm myself, I think my life is alright but I can’t change the way my thoughts bring me to dark places.

1j19ams,anxiety,2025-03-01 20:44:31,I just played with dirt and I feel so calm.,"One time I was in the gardening section of a store with my mom and I realized that the smell of the dirt was relaxing me. My mom then encouraged me to pot a few plants to have in my living space so that I could be around the smell more. 

I finally got around to doing that today. After I finished potting a plant, I spent a while playing with the dirt, breaking it down, massaging it, and so on. I think I did that for like half an hour. 

Funnily enough, when I was massaging the dirt, I felt like I was getting a massage myself. 

I genuinely don't remember the last time I've felt this calm. I almost want to cry because my mind is clear. My brain isn't running on overdrive worrying about every little thing.

Go get yourselves a bag of dirt. 

Edit: It's three hours later, and I'm still unimaginably calm. It has worn off a little bit, but this is still phenomenal compared to how I was before I played with dirt. 

I was even able to tell off my brain! I was thinking about how it was funny how dirt seemed to make everything alright, then my brain went, ""What are you talking about?! Nothing's alright!"" Then I told it to shut up and let me enjoy this. 

It listened.

I do yoga, I eat well, I run, I live in nature, I tend to a garden, I get outside the house every day, I live with others, and none of its helping. I feel like my brain is inflamed or sick because the thoughts are so intrusive. I used to live my life in anticipation of the future, or thinking happy memories in the past, but it's like something shook me so strongly and reminded me that all we really have is now and that realization is sobering. I am grieving everything I have lost and will lose.

I keep thinking about how everyone I love will die. All the beautiful birds I watch every day, they will die. The opossum under my bird feeder at night will die. My precious cats will die. It makes me so anxious to the point where I am genuinely feeling ill 24/7 and I cannot go anywhere or do anything without this constant anxious panic about death.

I assume most humans think about mortality but it is making me depressed and sad. I have been a generally happy person and I love life, but I feel like I've been mentally hit with a weight that just won't lift. I am a lover of nature and environmentalist and have always found so much awe and beauty in nature but now when I look out at the trees or the creeks I just see my own reflection of sadness and the constant anxiety I've lived with my whole life.

Why do we have to die? It doesn't bring me peace knowing my atoms will dissipate, it makes me sick. All I know is right before me, and all I know will be stripped away into nothing. So what is the point? What are we doing here? It feels like a sick game, and humans have gone so far off the rails that everything in our society seems like it is just some unhealthy coping strategy. 

I look at strangers and think of how fleeting their existence is too. I think about all the terrible ways humans treat each other and the Earth and my heart is just so full of grief for the amount of suffering I am witnessing. I literally cannot even look at lobster tanks in the grocery store without wanting to bawl my eyes out. The worst part is that death is starting to sound peaceful because at least I won't have to think. But I love thinking and I don't want to die. I keep imaging myself screaming and crawling during my final days and all I see is terror. It makes me think about the blackness after death. We don't even experience death. What if its because of the sheer terror of it all? Ugh. It makes me sick.

I am only 28 and I want to live a long and happy life, but this is by far the hardest experience in my life I've had to go through. I'm just so sad. I am crying all the time over my own death and the death of us all. I have isolated myself from society and I know that doesn't help. Is this just depression? Anxiety? PTSD? A mix of it all?",25,15,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1ji5iw1/i_cant_stop_feeling_extremely_anxious_about_death/,cant stop feeling extremely anxious death Hey guys posted couple days ago struggling recurring panic attacks nocturnal panic attacks made physically mentally exhausted soul feels tired also abruptly shook core made come face face fact going die panic attacks would come brain would say youre going drop dead thought loop makes head fuzzy yoga eat well run live nature tend garden get outside house every day live others none helping feel like brain inflamed sick thoughts intrusive used live life anticipation future thinking happy memories past like something shook strongly reminded really realization sobering grieving everything lost lose keep thinking everyone love die beautiful birds watch every day die opossum bird feeder night die precious cats die makes anxious point genuinely feeling ill 247 go anywhere anything without constant anxious panic death assume humans think mortality making depressed sad generally happy person love life feel like Ive mentally hit weight wont lift lover nature environmentalist always found much awe beauty nature look trees creeks see reflection sadness constant anxiety Ive lived whole life die doesnt bring peace knowing atoms dissipate makes sick know right know stripped away nothing point feels like sick game humans gone far rails everything society seems like unhealthy coping strategy look strangers think fleeting existence think terrible ways humans treat Earth heart full grief amount suffering witnessing literally even look lobster tanks grocery store without wanting bawl eyes worst part death starting sound peaceful least wont think love thinking dont want die keep imaging screaming crawling final days see terror makes think blackness death dont even experience death sheer terror Ugh makes sick 28 want live long happy life far hardest experience life Ive go Im sad crying time death death us isolated society know doesnt help depression Anxiety PTSD mix

__________________

Hey everyone, 
First time posting here, I'm just scared, I need to talk to someone about this.

I've had a panick attack a few days ago. Most of the time it takes up to two days for the symptoms to go away (brain fog, dissociation, fatigue...) but the panick itself does disappear quickly.
But here it's different, I'm terrified and hyperfocusing on subjects, and questionning my whole life so I can find the cause (to stop living with my boyfriend, quitting my job for a while) to the point it doesn't make sense, plus it appeared suddenly out of nowhere. I feel like I'm losing my damn mind.

The spiral doesn't stop and I'm in pain, I have to take my meds all day long to survive to the anxiety/panick. I'm staying at a friend's for the night right now but it doesn't change a thing....I'm terrified that I could be falling into depression which happened to me and was triggered by anxiety too.

Breathing exercises do help sometimes but it's not enough.

I'll try having an urgent appointment with my doctor tomorrow but the struggle is so strong, I just want it to stop. 

Did this kind of thing happen to you? How did you manage it?

Thank you so much in advance ",24,23,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1j5cru4/panicking_wont_stop_im_so_scared/,Panicking wont stop Im scared Edit thank sweet words helped lot came back read comments throughout day feel better Ive followed advices Im feeling relaxed tonight __________________ Hey everyone First time posting Im scared need talk someone Ive panick attack days ago time takes two days symptoms go away brain fog dissociation fatigue panick disappear quickly different Im terrified hyperfocusing subjects questionning whole life find cause stop living boyfriend quitting job point doesnt make sense plus appeared suddenly nowhere feel like Im losing damn mind spiral doesnt stop Im pain take meds day long survive anxietypanick Im staying friends night right doesnt change thingIm terrified could falling depression happened triggered anxiety Breathing exercises help sometimes enough Ill try urgent appointment doctor tomorrow struggle strong want stop kind thing happen manage Thank much advance
1jl5vkb,anxiety,2025-03-27 14:58:05,Anxiety is a pot of boiling water,"My therapist had the best analogy for anxiety that ACTUALLY helps me view it better when I'm in the midst of heightened anxiety:

  
Your anxiety is like a pot of boiling water on the front burner. When it boils over - the water has gotten too hot and you are not in control (ie an anxiety or panic attack). 

  
The goal of 'controlling' your anxiety isn't to forget about it. It's to take the pot of water and put it on the back burner. That water is still there and it's still hot. and it could boil at any point - but it's on the back burner cooling. 

Things like therapy, medications, walking, deep breathing, exercise, healthy food etc. (whatever works for you - anxiety is a tricky thing) cool the water down and/or help it stay cool. 

Spiraling thoughts, alcohol, missing out on sleep, caffeine, etc. are things that may warm that water back up. 

And the goal of anxiety management is to be aware of the pot - not to ignore it - and to work on keeping it cool. 

  
\^ This analogy has seriously helped me view my anxiety as a thing. and something I can actively 'work on the temp'. And I explained this analogy to my partner and now we have a common language for how I'm feeling. 'The pot is hot today' vs 'feelin luke warm - its a good one today'. 

  
Hope this helps someone. I was surprised at how much it helped me.

1jg95pp,anxiety,2025-03-21 04:57:07,My mom may have cancer,"
So my mom had blood work done and her WBC was 22. We thought maybe it’s a fluke, she got retested two weeks after and now it’s 37. And all her markers are up for white blood cells.

I’m positively devastated and my OCD and anxiety is flaring so bad- I can’t stop googling even though I know it’s bad. And I can’t stop blaming myself- thinking it’s God punishing me for needing my mom so much and having to move home as an adult for my mental health and now she’s going to be taken from me. Or that I didn’t appreciate her enough.

My therapist says I need to accept the possibility that people can get sick and die- and it’s not like I don’t understand that or don’t rationalize that. She tells me I can’t control my mom’s health and the course of life and I KNOW, god I know.

But my heart is broken and not having control to fix this and the idea of losing her and watching her get ill makes me want to curl up in a ball and disappear. 

I’m dying inside. I feel like I can’t breathe or think. 

Like normally my OCD and anxiety stuff is health stuff that is really irrational or even if it happened I’d be okay. And I’ve been doing so good with ERP, but the doctor throwing out leukemia and her results and my mom crying and being devastated. How am I suppose to cope with that reality, to accept that reality- that I could lose her? How I suppose to survive that?

She’s my best friend, my biggest comfort, my greatest
Joy and the most incredible mom in the world. My dad isn’t really a good person and my brother and I used to be close but his fiance doesn’t like me very much. So I feel like I have no one to turn too and like my life will just shatter and never recover if she dies. 

And I’m mad at my therapist for being like you have to accept bad things can happen- I know that for the love of god I know that. But it doesn’t mean that it’s not absolutely devastating and it shouldn’t be I just have to sit there and accept it. I just don’t know what to do. 

I know her results are really bad as someone who is studying medicine (not enough knowledge to diagnosis) so I just feel like I’m waiting for that shoe to drop with the diagnosis and just waiting to lose her",23,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1jg95pp/my_mom_may_have_cancer/,mom may cancer mom blood work done WBC 22 thought maybe fluke got retested two weeks 37 markers white blood cells Im positively devastated OCD anxiety flaring bad cant stop googling even though know bad cant stop blaming thinking God punishing needing mom much move home adult mental health shes going taken didnt appreciate enough therapist says need accept possibility people get sick die like dont understand dont rationalize tells cant control moms health course life KNOW god know heart broken control fix idea losing watching get ill makes want curl ball disappear Im dying inside feel like cant breathe think Like normally OCD anxiety stuff health stuff really irrational even happened Id okay Ive good ERP doctor throwing leukemia results mom crying devastated suppose cope reality accept reality could lose suppose survive Shes best friend biggest comfort greatest Joy incredible mom world dad isnt really good person brother used close fiance doesnt like much feel like one turn like life shatter never recover dies Im mad therapist like accept bad things happen know love god know doesnt mean absolutely devastating shouldnt sit accept dont know know results really bad someone studying medicine enough knowledge diagnosis feel like Im waiting shoe drop diagnosis waiting lose

1. Tell them you have anxiety! They wont judge i promise, they know people can be scared. If you feel comfortable, tell them exactly what it is that you fear and they might have tricks they can do to help you. 


2. Continuing the first one, i found out that the numbing solution in the needle they use has adrealine in it! Like straight up adrealine thats already propably running in your system at the moment making you anxious and shaky etc. If you tell them, they can use another kind that doesnt have that in it. I used to get massive shakes and heart racing which would freak me out even more, and i found out its from the numbing liquid! 


3. If youre afraid of gagging or overall have a sensitive gag reflex, tell them and they can put a sprinkle of salt on the tip of your tongue and it can completely eliminate your gag reflex! Life hack! Weird but works!


4. Ask them if you can set up a system, where if you put your finger or hand up that they will stop. This helped me soo much as i would every now and then get panicy about the fact that im like trapped in the chair (lol) i didnt ask them to stop once because just the thought that i can tell them to stop any time was enough to calm my panic.

Physical symptoms

|**Physical symptoms**|**Description**|
|:-|:-|
|SOB (Shortness of breath)|Random feelings of not being able to get enough air, this is how my journey started as I have developed chronic SOB|
|Numbness in the lips|Feeling like a tingle, numb in the lips, I could still move them, but I could feel them|
|Extreme neck tightness|Neck would feel very tight to the point of feeling like it is pulling my shoulders and head together|
|Extreme fatigue|I would feel very weak, especially days to weeks after an intense panic attack|
|Dizziness/Off balance/Floaty head feeling/Heavy head feeling|The worst one to describe, since it was very debilitating in a way to function normally, this was chronic and sometimes I had a day or a few hours without it, but it was almost always present|
|Intense dizzy spells|Sometimes the dizziness was strong and short lasting, like a spike that would try to kick start the panic|
|Ringin in ears|Just constant ringing|
|Fast heartbeat|Usually my resting heart rate was 85-95, a lot of the times it hit 110, during extreme panic attacks it hit up to 190. The panic attacks would last up to 2:30h, sometimes even all day on and off|
|Chest pain/burning|Sometimes I would get weird chest pains all over the place, also I would get a burning sensation in the middle of my chest|
|Chest pressure|I would feel the weird sensation of pressure on my chest, this could last for a couple of weeks.|
|Jelly legs|My legs would feel like they are very weak and like I would collapse at any time, almost like I cannot control them.|
|Headaches|Sometimes after the panic attacks I would get headaches.|
|Top of the neck pain|I would get sharp stabbing pain in the top of the neck|
|Palpatations|I would sometimes, during my panic attacks, feel like my heart would skip a beat. Feeling like there is a hole in my chest, like it is imploding for a second|
|Thick/Heavy pulse|Feeling my pulse all over my body, almost like my whole body would be thumping when my heart would beat, especially noticeable while lying down on the left side of the body|
|Morning panic attacks|I would wake up to my heart rate at 120, and it would stay like that for up to two hours after waking up|
|Numbness in left arm (pinky and ring finger), sometimes in right as well|I would feel tingles and numbness in my left arm|
|Back pain (left side between shoulder blade and spine)|Pain, that would vary in strength, but it was always present|
|Left latisimus pain|Sometimes it would happen, and it would be extreme and burning|
|Upset stomach|I would feel like I need to puke, even tho I would never puke, and my stomach was twisting|
|Instant urge to pee/poop|During extreme panic attacks, I would need to go to the toilet asap|
|Feeling like I would faint|I would get feelings like I would faint|
|Random pains|Just like sharp stabbing pain, randomly happening|
|Trouble sleeping|I would wake up during the night with dizziness, racing heart,...|
|Long after images|After seeing something bright, it lingered on in my vision for a long time|
|Seeing movement at the corner of my eyes|I would get a feeling/sensation that something just moved in the peripheral vision|
|Sensitivity to loud sounds|Be it music or any loud sound, I would feel like it would start a panic process for me. |
|Shooting tingles|I would feel like my body got zapped by some tingling sensation|

Other feelings/things

|Other feelings/things|Description|
|:-|:-|
|Catastrophizing|During the onset of panic, I could only think about worst case scenarios|

1jjhnyk,anxiety,2025-03-25 12:00:31,The idea of Pregnancy scares me to death," 
Basically what the title says, although there is currently no risk of it happening the thought of me (20M) impregnating someone terrifies me. In my life I've hooked up with four Women but never properly had sex so there's no chance of that happening right now I am still somewhat scared to have sex with a Girl because of what I've just said and if worst comes to worst that hell might extend to her wanting to keep the Child. 

Often when I open Facebook and other social media platforms it seems as if someone else my age or who I went to school with is either pregnant or going to be a Father and though I'm so glad it's not me burdened with a Child I sometimes worry that one day I will get unlucky. I'm honestly so young and there's so much I want to do with my life, I'm not sure if I ever want Children but certainly not now. 

This may seem irrational as I couldn't possibly have impregnated anyone so I don't have anything to worry about, I put it down to the fact I have Autism and often suffer from anxiety from it but seriously though the thought of this is pretty bad. I reckon if I think about it too much longer the anxiety is gonna give me diarrhoea.

1jlg2q7,anxiety,2025-03-27 22:43:45,My story of getting over anxiety and panic attacks hope this helps someone,"Hey,

So as stated above, I got over my anxiety and panic attacks (Sort of read more ). ( Male 25 currently )

Right, so a bit about me and my anxiety:

1. Had my first panic attack in 2023, which resulted in thinking I was having a heart attack and calling an ambulance. Imagine my surprise when I was told it was a panic attack, especially when the only anxiety I ever felt was during a presentation in front of a big crowd.
2. The first panic attack led me to call an ambulance for the next 6 nights, as it kept happening and I couldn't sleep at all during nighttime, and was confused about how to fix this.
3. The panic attacks then moved on from night time into daytime, which made me even more miserable, and after being sleep deprived for a month and getting depressed from this, I realised I had to do something.

**The process of understanding my panic attack process:**

1. The first thing I did was go at it symptom-wise. Once the panic attack starts, it spirals out of control into an ambulance call cause my brain says I am dying, help please. So did every test possible on my heart and other organs, including a brain, lung scan, and even checked for cancer just for fun. After getting all the results that no shit I am completely fine I was now reassured that I am not dying.
2. The panic attacks still happened constantly, but they stopped spiraling into an ambulance call, as now I was sure I was not dying, it just meant I had to suffer my brain going at 500 km/h for the next 30 mins until I fried myself out. So this was the next step I needed to fix to stop this process.

**The process of finding a ""cure"":**

1. This was the more difficult part as I was physically healthy it meant my mind was fucked. Now a psychologist seems like a scam in my head as they just read books, passed some test and got their shit license / or they don't even have one. I chose psychotherapy, meaning a medical specialist who can help me.
2. The psychotherapist (from now on referred to as therapist for easier writing), during my first sit down that lasted always 60mins on the dot, asked one simple question what do I want out of this I explained I want to stop having panic attacks, she explained I can just take Xanax and be done with it. Which was a fair take, I had these drugs with me, I didn't like taking them as it slowed my brain down to such a point where I felt like a zombie. So she asked again What do I want to achieve with this? This time, after thinking for a few minutes, I explained I want to get my life back, meaning sleeping and enjoying life without thinking and anticipating that I am about to feel like I am dying. Now this was a small but very important moment in my battle with this new anxiety. She said this "" Your subconscious now has understood that there is a psychological problem,"" which she was correct in. This was not a disease like a common flu this was my brain saying hey somethings wrong fix it or i will keep fucking your life. After this I was now ready to start fixing my life.

**What is a panic attack?**

1. Panic attacks are your subconscious not agreeing with your conscious mind. Meaning my reality is going against everything my brain was programmed with from my young developing years. In total, I did 5 sessions 60 minutes each, 1 session per month. The reason for this was this explanation from my therapist:

"" Your subconscious takes 30 days to undergo a change, and you can only speak with it for 60 minutes. ""

**How do you speak with your sub-concious?**

My sessions went like this, a 5-minute. talk about how my life is going, if anything has changed, and then a 5-minute ""ritual"" more like guiding steps I have to do with my eyes close,d which would lead to a whole world opening in my mind. I would have these visions which I won't go into detail cause of course personal stuff, but your subconscious is so strong you can feel wind, water, heat, sadness, happiness,s and even pain while doing this. During my third session, I was able to not just see but also walk around instead of being just guided by my mind. Being able to stop and analyze was important. Now, if anyone is interested, I can explain in the comments the process to do this as I have been doing this as a party trick now, I just won't be able to explain what you saw, it's for you to analyze :D

**My last session, a 5-month result:**

After the 5 sessions, I have realised the life I was living was going against my mind and my brain was protesting against it now it's not something I can fix in one day after realising, but the 5 sessions in which my therapist pretty much just listened what I saw and wrote my panic attacks every month got less and less frequent. It's as if my two consciousnesses were now slowly starting to agree as there was more understanding of each other. This made them less frequent, but as i said in session 1 I want them fcking gone.

**After all this, this was the final fix:**

The final fix will sound stupid, but quote my therapist here:

""We have the ability to program ourselves and our minds, all you have to do is do it."" Now, if you told me this 5 months ago, I would have called this person a scam artist or a cult leader. But now feeling more in touch with my brain, I got to thinking, can I do it?

I asked my therapist for more sessions, he said this is the MAX amount any person should need, and this is it now, work on it. So I got home, the day went by, I kept thinking about it, and once again I went to bed I had a panic attack. Only this time, this was my thought process:

1. I am not dying

2 This is a panic attack

3. Why are you sending me this signal?

And during my third question in my head I felt an answer or a thought, I still don't know what it is, but I had a sudden impulse to go make green mint tea. I heated my water, I made the tea, I drank it panic attack was gone while I was making it. I thought, OK weird, the next day, same again. I go to bed, have a panic attack, I press the button to make the tea panic attack gone.

And on the third day, I made green tea before going to bed, and I haven't had a panic attack since, except anxiety when I still have to present in front of a big crowd :P

**What the fuck is with this mint tea?**

Now, after all this, I called my therapist and explained the situation and asked if this was what she meant, should I just drink tea, is this some magical fix?

Now it turns out I have hyper brain activity, as most people do these days, it's not ADHD, it's just the brain always working very fast, it doesn't mean you can't focus. And my ""talks"" or ""meetings"" with my subconscious somehow made me understand that hey, let's make this ritual of making mint tea before we go to bed, which can cool our brain down, and also mint has a relaxing effect too.

**So mint tea = no panic attacks?**

For me, yes; for you, no.

This story is about the process I went through to understand my condition and how I got in touch with my core consciousness. Since those sessions my outlook on life was clearer I was more happy and I was overall enjoying life more after every session even while I was still having panic attacks, so what I recommend to you is going to a psychotherapist a real doctor and trying this method out or just thinking about this on your own as I still have a habit of speaking to my self when I am laying in bed just mimicking a discussion and see if any bad thoughts come up.

If you read all of this, I hope this helps you somehow, and don't settle for just taking medicine, you are just avoiding and suppressing your mind instead of fixing it.

**THE REPLY ABOUT THE PROCESS: (also this got way more attention than I thought xd )**

Well first of all it takes two people as someone needs to be your guiding voice:

1. You sit down on a couch, sofa or arm chair sth that is comfortable.
2. Close your eyes and relax don't cross your legs or arms just have them straight next and relaxed almost as if they are limp.
3. Now once your sitting relaxed and comfortable the seconds person needs to start the guiding.

THE PROCESS:

1. The guiding person should start speaking in a calm voice through this whole time. I will just write the exact words he needs to say with a few second pauses ( This is translated from my own language so make some adjustments to make it sound correct in your lagnague)

"" You feel a small warmth in at the center at your chest, pause 2s you can start to feel it going down through your ribs, your stomach and it stays there you feel it there making you warmer and warmer almost too warm but pleasant like a warm bath, from there it goes on down to your legs, the warmth spreads to your knees, the back of your feet and finally reaching the tip of your fingers staying there. PAUSE 6s. From here, it starts going back up once again from your toes, going to your knees, your stomach, and stopping at your chest area once again, stopping but then moving on to your arms. It reaches your shoulders, your arms, your palms and staying at your fingertips. The warmth is warming up your fingers as if a fire on a cold, snowy day. (PAUSE) It then moves back once more, reaching your chest and this time going u,p warming your spine, reaching your ears and stopping at the top of your head. What do you see? ""

HOW TO NAVIGATE:

At the what do you see point, you don't open your eyes an image should pop up in your eyes, some sort of image. It can be as simple as a forest, a road and it's the second person's job to guide you.  They can never suggest you do something, they can only ask and give a small hint and only communicate when you stop talking or exploring, they can't interrupt your process. For example my first image was a forest view. My therapist asked explain in detail what I see. I started explain the color of the trees and explained that something doesn't seem right ( she doesn't ask me what ), she waits for me to open up my self as the answer just pops into my head usually. I explained this view is fake and I recognise it it was the Windows XP screen saver and it's not real, and I am not aware what to do in an image not a real forest.

She then finally asked me if I could look around in all directions. That's when I notice I have legs and decide to walk on my own and I walk into this fake image that pops up a big door ,which I enter. (won't tell more here as it's private ) and I am aware this sounds like a random dude on the internet making shit up but trust me I was as freaked out myself xd

Some common tricks I learned and questions for the leading person

We can identify our age in these visions, by looking at our feet small feet young age, larger older.

Usually, the stuff we don't want is behind us or in dark areas.

If you encounter darkness you can try to walk into it but you can also not be allowed which is called a sub conscious block. I have had these areas in my visions always at some point I would reach them, but I had friends who would break the darkness and go past it.

A friend of mine wanted this experience he landed in a forest as he liked nature a lot at first it was fun cool (his feet were as if of a baby) as he kept going deeper and deeper the forest turned dark I asked him how he feels in this new forest, he explained fear, anxiety and painful coldness at this point he asked me should he continue and this is the response your guiding person should give always "" Its your vision you choose what to do"" he kept going forward as he was also interested the deeper he went the colder and darker it got and thicker but after walking in his mind for at least 10mins and real life 10 mins he reached light and warmth when he looked at his feet in the cold forest they were bigger but still of a young kid, when he left the dark forest his feet looked as that of an adult.

Now maybe it means sth about his childhood idk that's why I said you need a professional to analyze it, but it helped him realise sth about him self that he kept to him

It’s hard because it’s sucking up my energy, I read about pulsetto and im thinking about getting it. But i just want to know what you guys have done or still do that significantly helps lower it.

1j3ttdk,anxiety,2025-03-05 03:27:56,Have you taken Lorazepam? I am too scared to take it.,"I am generally high strung and over think a bit but I don’t find myself feeling anxious in my daily life. Until night time, where everything falls apart. I have total panic attacks, I am nauseous, shaking, feeling cold, nose and fingers are cold to the touch, I cry, pace, I am completely irrational. And this goes on for potentially hours (the bad ones are about 3 hours). Because I don’t really have other symptoms or even daily experiences of anxiety, I got this prescription. Upside: Ideally I’ll get more freedom in my life and not be held back at the idea of having a freak out in a foreign place, around different people. Downside: I have “drug trauma” (made that up… best way I could describe it). Due to a self inflicted experience as a teenager, my anxiety around being impaired is shaky. Even while consuming alcohol I get the feeling of loss of control over the situation, like I can’t soothe a panic attack if it arises… which causes a freak out. I am scared of taking it and feeling like I am too impaired to soothe a panic attack and that making it worse. 

Now that you know my full life story, I need advice or testimonials.

Despite how inseparable I am with my sibling and my parents, I can only count on both hands the amount of times I’ve received hugs from them in a while.

I had never felt so safe in my life up until that point, and she ended up hugging me in the backseat of her car while I sobbed for an hour. I want to hug and cuddle and be touched (both non-sexually and sexually) by someone so bad that it’s hurting, but at the same time whenever someone even slightly touches me I get extremely uncomfortable.

 Specifically, the innocent bystandered said "" there are good ones, "" referring to every American that is protesting against everything. When, the person who was spewing hate said "" go and Google what good Germans were in the 1930's, "" which gets me angry on two counts. 

More sort than that, I am sad and upset that everything is falling apart all around me. While my anxiety is urging me to panic and freak out, as my mental health has completely deteriorated over the past recent months. Everything is taking it's toll on me and I can't take it anymore.....

1j50tg6,mentalhealth,2025-03-06 17:26:33,My mother has been trying to break me my entire life,"Sorry in advance if the post is really long.

I got this email from my mother 2 days ago. I found it before I got in bed last night, and I’ve been awake ever since. (It’s 6am in NZ)

I lived with this woman my whole life, enduring physical assaults and emotional abuse for years as a child. At 16, I had a restraining order against her and went to live full-time with my grandparents until I moved out of town as a young adult. I cut her off completely

Since becoming an adult and making my own life, I allowed her back into my life slowly and with a lot of boundaries, in hopes of being able to finally push her to get the help she’s always needed. It wasn’t easy, there have been many situations where I should’ve cut her off for good, but I was scared if I didn’t keep her happy then she would take it out on my siblings.

In the end, she chose not to get help, the abuse got really bad again and she started sending me horrible messages again, so at the end of last year I finally blocked her again.

Now, I’m 28 years old, I own my own home with my fiancé (who is amazing), I’m excelling in my career, yet I’m broken. I just can’t take it anymore, I just want her out of my life for good so I can focus on my own life as I prepare to marry my partner and start a family of our own, but with every nasty text, email or message, I just shatter more and more. I’m scared to become a mother and I end up just like her.

Over the last 12 years of this, I’ve dealt with NZ Police, Child Welfare services, Hospitals & Mental Health services. I have over ten years worth of screenshots of horrible messages she sent me, everything has been reported and nothing has happened because she’s “not threatening”, but someone out there has to agree that this is NOT OKAY to send someone and REGARDLESS of anyone’s mental health situation, behaviour like this has to be held accountable. Am I just supposed to ignore it and pretend it doesn’t affect me anymore? I’m at my wits end. I’m depressed, I feel hopeless, I don’t know what to do.

Please someone just tell me what to do to end this for good (besides obviously getting therapy. I’ve been through therapy and counselling before, but I can’t afford it right now so it’s not an option for me). Or even if you can give me some insight, maybe you’ve dealt with something similar?

1j3hi09,mentalhealth,2025-03-04 18:19:32,Assaulted over the weekend by my friend’s husband and I am feeling absolutely broken.,"Went to a friend/coworker’s house over the weekend. Her, her husband and I all hung out and were listening to music and dancing. Had some drinks. Friend went to bed. I went to lay down in their spare bedroom. The husband followed me and assaulted me. I tried to fight back and kept saying no, but he wouldn’t stop. No protection.

I went to the ER yesterday and got the assault kit done. The SANE nurse and the patient advocate were the most kind, “best friend” type of figures I could’ve ever asked for. They made me feel empowered, listened to, cared for, and worth living. I felt so at ease in their presence. They were angels.

I don’t really have a support system. My parents are both good people but I don’t want to make them worry. I couldn’t imagine telling them this. It’s very disturbing to me, and I don’t want to unload this onto them and I don’t want them to have to think about me like that - it’s just disturbing. I’m also gay and have been out since I was in my teens so I feel like people will find this extra disturbing if that makes sense.

The one “best friend” I do have… I called him. He didn’t answer. I texted him what happened. He was nice and supportive in his texts, but I was really hurt that he couldn’t even call me back. He couldn’t even show up on my doorstep. He had the day off. A few years ago, one of our friends in our friend group was raped, and guess what? He was so protective of her. He went to her house and lived on her couch for a week to support her everyday through it. And I’m not worthy enough of a phone call. Major ouch. I have been there for this best friend through their worst moments, always showing up, letting them cry on my shoulder… and I’m not even worth a call back. This just adds an extra layer of hurt on top of what I’m already dealing with.

My lack of support system really has me crumbling underneath all of this. Im so angry and hurt. I’m a nurse and I am now on a leave of absence and am trying to get myself in a partial hospitalization program. I’m sure I’ll meet some people there but at the end of the day when I go home, all I have is me, myself and I. I can’t handle this alone. My best friend not showing up for me when I need them more than anything (this isn’t the first occurrence) is crushing me. 

I don’t know what to do. I feel absolutely alone in this and feel like I’m fighting to keep my head above water. It feels like I’ll never heal from this.

1j4vacl,mentalhealth,2025-03-06 13:20:46,My wife cheated now I'm depressed and she just yells,"I (33f) had 7 miscarriages. After each one my wife (31f) screamed at me she'd cheat on me since I can't give her a kid. She would scream it's my fault, corner me as I cried, never hugged me never comforted me. I begged for a break from trying to get back to us. She refused which lead to my tubes rupturing and now cannot try again. 
She stopped talking to me after that. I almost died but she only cared about getting a kid. So she tried to carry. 
It worked the first round. She started getting super anxious.  Every person was out to get her. Neighbors wanted her ""dead"". Everything in the world was against her. She would pull knives and threaten me. She would try to kill the neighbors with the same knife that I would have to wrestle from her.
She believes if we didn't think the same as her that we weren't supportive. But no the 16 yr old smoking pot in her own apartment isn't out to harm you. 
I did everything she asked. Knocked on every door to ask ppl to refrain from doing what they legally are allowed because we are pregnant. That wasn't good enough. I bought and installed blockers on our doors and windows to block any smell she may get a whiff of. Not good enough.
I'm disabled but I took on all physical chores. I got bitched out for being in paid and passing out when it got too painful. 
When I would ask if it was okay to nap after a rough day she would say yes only to freak out after I was asleep and physically pull me from the bed. She dislocated my leg and hip and threw out my back from yanking me so hard. 
Then she cheats on me and says it's because I don't support her and am miserable.

1jffm9e,mentalhealth,2025-03-20 03:14:30,"HOT TAKE:  Reddit is not therapy… honestly, it’s the opposite sometimes.","I don’t know who needs to hear this, but be careful coming here when you’re really struggling. Reddit can feel like the only place to vent because it’s anonymous, but let’s be real—people here are *cruel*. Cold. Dismissive.  
It’s easy to forget there are actual human beings behind the screen, but it feels even easier for people to forget *you’re* a real human when you post.

You open up about your worst thoughts, just hoping for someone to say, “Hey, I’ve been there too”... and instead you get hit with:

* “Seek help.”
* “Why would you even post this?”
* “You sound like a burden.”
* Or worse—downvotes into oblivion, like your feelings don’t matter at all.

And that messes you up more. Makes you wonder if you *are* too much. If maybe the world really is as cold as it feels.

But you’re not. You’re just trying to survive. Trying to feel seen somewhere, *anywhere*.

Reddit isn’t therapy. Half the people here are fighting their own battles, some too numb to care, some projecting their pain right back at you. And it hurts, because you deserve *so much more* than this.  
You deserve someone who looks you in the eye, listens, and says, *“I’m glad you’re still here.”*  
Not another stranger trying to win internet points off your pain.

Please don’t let this place convince you that you’re unlovable.  
You’re not. You’re a human being who deserves real love, real care, real connection. Reddit will never be enough for that.

Anything I enjoy in my free time (watching TV/movies, listening to music) isn’t considered a hobby. I do like to read books and go on holiday but that isn’t considered as respectable as “travelling”.

If someone doesn’t have a “hobby”, it’s probably because they’re doing their best just to stay alive. I get literally no joy out of anything anymore, no I’m not suddenly going to start painting or horse riding or whatever the fuck that I have absolutely no talent at just to please society. Also “hobbies” are expensive.

“What are your hobbies” is such a loaded question and you can just feel the judgement when you’re honest. It doesn’t make you less of a human being.

I've never had the greatest mental health, and I've never been in a position to afford to treat said mental health. My go to has always been to disassociate. Probably not the best way to deal, but it's gotten me through. I'm finally in a good place, with decent health insurance, to be able to talk to someone about my mental health.

But what's the point of going to see someone about my mental health if they want to prescribe medication? That medication is about to be unavailable. What's the point of talking to someone when I know that the world around me is burning?

So I drink more than I should. I have a bit of marijuana to take off the edge. 

But disassociating isn't working anymore. Everything is tarnished by thoughts of fascists and war and collapse.

And I just don't know what to do or how to handle anything anymore. I'm 45 years old and for the first time ever I looked in the mirror and thought that it might be easier to just end it. I know it's not the answer. I know I need to fight for myself, my friends and my country.

1j7ke82,mentalhealth,2025-03-09 23:06:45,Mourning the life that doesn’t exist because you never got helped as a child.,"Over the last 2.5 years I have been working with my doctor to try to figure out why my sleep is so bad. It’s always been bad, but became disabling after I turned 40. I’ll explain more of this in a moment but this started my healing.

When I was 13, I got into a lot of trouble, I struggled in school and became violent. This was back in the 90s where bullying wasn’t taken seriously and I was often told to be the bigger person while my bully never got into trouble. The first time I hit someone and they feared me instead of pitying me, and the bullying stopped. I felt like I finally had power over the situation. Teachers weren’t helping, neither were my parents.

Fighting ultimately led to me being arrested and I was put into juvenile detention, I was court ordered to see a psychiatrist for an evaluation, I was put in a hospital. My father pulled me out after it was done and they told me they said I was “a spoiled brat.” My family never spoke of this again until I was in my 30s right before my dad passed away, he confessed I was diagnosed with adhd. Even then I wasn’t sure what to do with that information.

My entire life has been one struggle after another. So many poor choices, homelessness, not being able to hold a job, huge parts of my life I don’t even remember. I feel like I blinked and went from 20 to 30.

I met my husband 14 years ago, and he had his own issues too but we overcame, we pulled ourselves out of hell. He’s mostly to thank for that but he’s stayed with me through all of my issues, and loves me. He is amazing in so many ways. However, my health and mental state were starting to wear on him too. I still couldn’t hold down jobs, the longest job I’ve had is 2 years. He was getting fed up. I started seeing my current doctor.

So, I'm working with my doctor. I can’t sleep, I go for weeks on 3 hours of sleep. I get treated for insomnia, depression, and anxiety. Lots of medications and lots of nasty side effects. I had other health issues and she has fixed each one as they come up. Ive become healthier overall.

She suggested testing me for mood disorders like bipolar, and that's when it hit me and I remembered what my father had told me about my adhd diagnosis. I told her about that and she typed on her little computer and asked me like 20 questions. I scored 16/20. She said she’s confident enough to diagnose me with inattentive adhd. She prescribed me some medicine and I went home and took it.

At first, I cried. I cried because it felt like someone had removed the iron plate that's been sitting on my head my entire life. All of a sudden things were quiet, I could think about one thing instead of jumping all around. I could finish my train of thought. I felt more relaxed at that moment than I ever have in my entire life. I cried for hours. Then. I slept. I slept for 7 hours. I slept!

Then it hit me. Would I have chosen path A instead of path B if I had just got help when I was a kid? Would I be in a high paying senior position somewhere making 6 figures right now? Would I have followed my dream and been an oceanographer or possibly a nurse? 

All of the what ifs hit me hard, and then I mourned that person. I felt so alone, and betrayed. I grew angry at my father and mother all over again. I’ve come to accept it. I am who I am, I can just move forward. I have the job I have at amazon because of untreated adhd. I look the way I do because of untreated ADHD. Right now though, I am happy I can sleep.

1jgcbbq,mentalhealth,2025-03-21 08:47:54,i hate chatgpt.,"i don't like how many people i see on this subreddit, or other mental health subreddits encouraging the use of chatgpt, however i don't really blame them. chatgpt doesn't know anything about your past, nor does it have the experience a human does, therefore it can't be empathetic in the same way and give you actual useful advice - most of it is from google that i find usually isn't too helpful for more severe, or intense illnesses or symptoms. on top of that, since chatgpt only mimics the empathy of a human, it's not giving you the real love and support like how an actual human would, if that makes sense. i don't think chatgpt is always horrible, for example i think chatgpt can be great for understanding things like the mental illness you have and it's symptoms. but it's absolutely not a replacement for real, human compassion and interaction.

on the other hand though, I understand people simply can't afford professional help thanks to the economy, as well as fear of judgment. i feel like people are so comfortable bullying people simply because they're different from them, or when they see a mental illness/symptom that isn't ""pretty"" they instantly make fun of that person, calling them gross, or a freak, psycho, or way worse. this literally disencourages people from getting the help that they need, and i think it happens way more than we're willing to admit. even for the most horrible symptoms, if you genuinely want someone to get help you have to be willing to sit down and understand where they're coming from.

idk...sorry about this long rant. i just think its really sad how people feel like they need to resort to something that's barely human at all to get just a tiny bit of help with their issues :(",69,53,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1jgcbbq/i_hate_chatgpt/,hate chatgpt dont like many people see subreddit mental health subreddits encouraging use chatgpt however dont really blame chatgpt doesnt know anything past experience human therefore cant empathetic way give actual useful advice google find usually isnt helpful severe intense illnesses symptoms top since chatgpt mimics empathy human giving real love support like actual human would makes sense dont think chatgpt always horrible example think chatgpt great understanding things like mental illness symptoms absolutely replacement real human compassion interaction hand though understand people simply cant afford professional help thanks economy well fear judgment feel like people comfortable bullying people simply theyre different see mental illnesssymptom isnt pretty instantly make fun person calling gross freak psycho way worse literally disencourages people getting help need think happens way willing admit even horrible symptoms genuinely want someone get help willing sit understand theyre coming idksorry long rant think really sad people feel like need resort something thats barely human get tiny bit help issues

In my coaching classes, even though I’m introverted, girls would approach me, and friendships often turned flirty. One girl, in particular, was really sweet, and I knew from the start she liked me in a romantic way. Over time, she started imagining a future with me, and things got complicated. I didn’t want to hurt her, but the situation became so overwhelming that I fell into depression for weeks. Eventually, I couldn’t take it anymore and left coaching.

Even female teachers sometimes get too personal—sharing secrets with me, treating me differently, or even asking me out. It’s distracting, especially during exams when a teacher keeps looking at me or smiling, making it hard to focus. I’ve even found myself praying before classes, hoping not to get a female teacher.

1j614cs,mentalhealth,2025-03-07 21:42:29,My words drove my girlfriend to a suicide attempt,"I (20f) had an argument with my (21f) gf yesterday and I ended up saying some very mean things to her out of anger, I told her i was sick of her and basically implied i would leave her. I realized what I had done and went to apologize 20minutes after i said these things. However it seemed like she had been drinking heavily during the argument and when I texted her again she wasn't spelling anything correctly,  I pretty much couldnt make out anything she was saying , but i was able to make out the words ""arm"" and ""ambulance"" so i called her immediately. she was crying out loud begging me to go see her saying she couldnt move or breathe and that she was bleeding. she lives a 1hr walk away from me so i was panicking because it would take me too long to get to her house and it was late at night. i hung up on her to tell her friend what was going on but when i called back again after like 2min her phone was off. 



after this i just immediately left the house to go see her. i couldnt call an ambulance because i didnt know what her exact home address was, she lives in a huge neighborhood with lots of houses that look the same and we've always went there together so i got lost for a bit trying to find it myself , my plan was to call an ambulance once i found her house but when i got there there were cops and they told me they had already taken her to the hospital and that she was alright. i wasnt in my right mind so i didnt even ask which hospital and refused to answer any question the cops asked, once i heard she was ok i left to go back home before it could get way too late. 



the next day it fucking hit me that i have no idea where she is , i have no idea who called the ambulance bc it wasnt me or the only other person who knew , her phone is still dead , she doesnt talk much to her family members so i dont have their numbers and i have no one to ask about her but thankfully a woman from the hospital she was in contacted me to tell me they were sending her to what is basically a mental asylum. i live in an extremely shitty country so the room they had put her in was a fucked up small room with just a bed in it, nothing else. it broke my heart to see her alone and scared in that hellhole covered in dried blood stains and lots of bandages wrapped around her arm. she's basically imprisoned, she's being treated in such an inhumane way that i dont even want to talk about and they said they would keep her in there for a while. 



i cant wrap my head around the fact that if i had never said those words this would've never happened. i cant believe that i could've lost the person i love the most over the fact i chose to be a mean bitch despite knowing how much her entire mental state depends on me and how scared she is of losing me. she tried to end her own life because she thought i was going to leave her. i have no idea how im supposed to live with this guilt , this has probably been the worst 24 hours of my life and i cant believe everything was normal just a day ago and now she's gonna lose her job and be treated like a psycho for the rest of her life just because of this. im in so much pain that i dont even have the words to describe it bc ive never been in this situation before. tomorrow i have to get in her house to get her phone and clothes and i dont know how ill react when i see her blood on the floor. i dont know how to deal with this and i have no one to rely on, please help me.",50,39,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1j614cs/my_words_drove_my_girlfriend_to_a_suicide_attempt/,words drove girlfriend suicide attempt 20f argument 21f gf yesterday ended saying mean things anger told sick basically implied would leave realized done went apologize 20minutes said things However seemed like drinking heavily argument texted wasnt spelling anything correctly pretty much couldnt make anything saying able make words arm ambulance called immediately crying loud begging go see saying couldnt move breathe bleeding lives 1hr walk away panicking would take long get house late night hung tell friend going called back like 2min phone immediately left house go see couldnt call ambulance didnt know exact home address lives huge neighborhood lots houses look weve always went together got lost bit trying find plan call ambulance found house got cops told already taken hospital alright wasnt right mind didnt even ask hospital refused answer question cops asked heard ok left go back home could get way late next day fucking hit idea idea called ambulance bc wasnt person knew phone still dead doesnt talk much family members dont numbers one ask thankfully woman hospital contacted tell sending basically mental asylum live extremely shitty country room put fucked small room bed nothing else broke heart see alone scared hellhole covered dried blood stains lots bandages wrapped around arm shes basically imprisoned shes treated inhumane way dont even want talk said would keep cant wrap head around fact never said words wouldve never happened cant believe couldve lost person love fact chose mean bitch despite knowing much entire mental state depends scared losing tried end life thought going leave idea im supposed live guilt probably worst 24 hours life cant believe everything normal day ago shes gon na lose job treated like psycho rest life im much pain dont even words describe bc ive never situation tomorrow get house get phone clothes dont know ill react see blood floor dont know deal one rely please help

After texting them, i quickly got connected to a counselor. She explain who she was and asked why I was texting 988. I told her about my self harm and how I couldn’t stop. Throughout the entire conversation I was constantly reassured that she was there for me and that her only intention was to help. I got some actual advice from her and unlike what other people say, it definitely wasnt AI (at least in my experience) i genuinely felt so incredibly heard. I was lowkey talking with AI to at least get advice and something about having a genuine human interaction made me feel just overall better. I probably wont get another experience like that again though. I have been through the whole ordeal of the American mental health system. It’s absolutely bullshit.

Call for Help

Hello, I'm 22F. (French)

I've been taking venlafaxine 150 mg since I was 16. Last year, I went abroad for a year and, due to a prescription error, I was forced to halve my dose for six months. The first few days were horrible, but I quickly got used to it.

When I returned to France, I decided to go back to 150 mg because the return was a bit difficult.
I started working in a hotel in December when the problems started. (I'd already been waking up sometimes with swelling in random places on my body for six months, but I blamed that on the humid climate.)

But this swelling persisted and came back with a vengeance. I sometimes wake up with a swollen hand, foot, finger, or eye.  I also sometimes have swelling on the soles of my feet, which makes it difficult to walk. It's also accompanied by severe hives all over my body (photo attached).

It's quite difficult psychologically, because no doctor has been able to help me, and only cortisone works. I scratch all day long, sometimes until I bleed. During severe attacks, the itching is so intense that I scratch with a brush or scissors.

Two weeks ago, I accidentally opened the venlafaxine leaflet and discovered that swelling and hives were listed as side effects. But the doctors don't think I've developed an allergy after years of treatment. After yet another appointment, the doctor put me back on 75 mg and increased my antihistamine dose.

So, that's been two or three weeks.  The first few days of withdrawal were excruciating, but it quickly calmed down. The hives and swelling are still there but have calmed down significantly.
But now, my mental state has been in freefall for a few days. I've rarely felt like this. I'm paranoid, I always have a lump in my stomach, I'm always on the verge of crying, I cry whenever I get the chance. I see everything in black.

I don't know what to do. I don't want to increase the dose because I'd like to get off this medication long-term, as I have too many other side effects (drowsiness, libido, electric shock in my brain, etc.). Incidentally, I've never been diagnosed with depression or anything like that. I just went there as a teenager for a feeling of unease (like all teenagers in the world, really), and they gave me a drastic treatment.  (I've since stopped taking anti-anxiety medications.)

Well, I'm not even sure if this phase where I'm not feeling well is due to withdrawal. So that's why I'd like to know your experiences with venlafaxine Effexor and antidepressant withdrawal in general.

She had multiple breakdowns because she felt like we don't have enough support in my hometown. Her family lives in another state. I was doing my best to support her throughout the pregnancy and our son just turned one, I feel like we're finally just getting into a groove.

Earlier this month she mentions she wants another kid soon, I expressed that we should reflect on our first experience and wait til we feel ready. She responds with, having kids is hard, doesn't mean we shouldn't do hard things and said I wasn't a big fan of responsibility. 

That kind of hurt because I was her support system and did everything I could to make her pregnancy as easy as possible and even with the kid I stayed home for the first 4 months just being with the baby. 

I'll be honest and say I did those things for me, I love her and wanted to help and I also wanted to enjoy some months with my first son.

Today I (18F) told my mother that I wished I was dead. I've been in and out of school due to mental health issues such as OCD and Social Anxiety and also lack of motivation. I haven't been able to keep a job more than half a year and It's been really rough staying at home feeling like a failure. I was supposed to go for an interview today after weeks and weeks of looking for a job. I was getting ready but no outfits that I picked looked right on me and I was beginning to panic. I didn't have any formal clothes so I had to improvise.

Everytime I put something on I hated how my body looked in it. Time ran out and I new I was going to be late. I told my mum I wasn't going and she got upset saying that I always do this, always change last minute, saying that what I had on was fine and there was nothing wrong with it. She told me that I've wasted an opportunity. I don't know what happened but I just blurted out ""I wish that I was dead"". She thought I was saying that because I couldn't find an outfit.

I don't think my mum's ever taken my mental state seriously and I think it's because she doesn't understand it but anyways,
I then left the house for a bit to cool down, had a cry and then came home. 

She called me to talk but the whole time she was talking I just tuned her out. She asked me what I was going to do and I told her I didn't know. 
I'm feeling quite lost at the moment and after this I feel like dying more than ever. I really regret the way things played out.

Hi everyone I’m a 22F and I don’t even know why I’m posting this, but I guess I just need to put it somewhere. I’ve never felt this alone in my life. Because of family circumstances, I can’t leave the house much, and it’s made it almost impossible to maintain friendships or make new ones. I struggle with my mental health already, and I don’t want to keep leaning on the few people I have—I feel like I’m just exhausting them.

But the truth is, I really, really just want friends. I want people to talk to, to laugh with, to feel like I exist in the world outside these four walls. Instead, every day feels the same, and I’m just here, invisible, while life moves on without me.

If you’ve ever been through this, how did you handle it? How do you find connection when you can’t even go out and meet people?

1jcjpjl,mentalhealth,2025-03-16 11:47:48,Is watching gore bad for you?,"This may be a bit of a dumb question, I'm sure it does have negative impacts, but when I tried looking it up I really only found stuff about gore in movies and thats probably different than seeing actual gore.

A year or two ago I remember looking at the subreddit r/eyeblech, but then it got banned lol. I only looked at it from time to time out of curiosity so I didnt bother looking for another place to watch gore once it was banned. 

However a couple months ago the morbid curiosity came back so I began looking for places to watch it again. I found a site dedicated to posting gore, so the people on there are way worse than the people on the subreddit. Like if they're genuine about what they say then they're some of the most horrible people alive. 

I've been looking at that site almost daily ever since. I'm worried that I'll start internalizing the things said there and I'll become less empathetic. I've had a couple dreams of me violently killing people (including my family) but I want to clarify I have no desire to inflict harm on anyone. My age may also be an issue because I'm 15 and gonna turn 16 soon so my brain is still developing. It's not like I feel nothing when watching it, sometimes I feel heavy in my chest and there are some really brutal vids that are too painful to watch without looking away. 

But just how harmful is it? I have always had good mental health and it hasnt gotten worse or anything.  It just seems like it's not really impacting me much (for now).",23,60,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1jcjpjl/is_watching_gore_bad_for_you/,watching gore bad may bit dumb question Im sure negative impacts tried looking really found stuff gore movies thats probably different seeing actual gore year two ago remember looking subreddit reyeblech got banned lol looked time time curiosity didnt bother looking another place watch gore banned However couple months ago morbid curiosity came back began looking places watch found site dedicated posting gore people way worse people subreddit Like theyre genuine say theyre horrible people alive Ive looking site almost daily ever since Im worried Ill start internalizing things said Ill become less empathetic Ive couple dreams violently killing people including family want clarify desire inflict harm anyone age may also issue Im 15 gon na turn 16 soon brain still developing like feel nothing watching sometimes feel heavy chest really brutal vids painful watch without looking away harmful always good mental health hasnt gotten worse anything seems like really impacting much

But I'm tired of living on the edge of defeat like this and I want to try to get better before it's too late. So I thought something as ""small"" as brushing my teeth twice a day regularly would be a good goal. 

However, I've always struggled with this habit. The hopelessness doesn't help. So every time I have to brush my teeth, it feels like a boss fight. I'm in the bathroom staring at the brush, or I'm standing and walking around for 10min, until I either randomly manage to get it done, or not and go back to my room. 

I've tried switching toothpaste to something more flavorful, or have music or any kind of entertainment on my phone on, brush during shower, even removing steps like brushing without toothpaste, but nothing really works to make me do it consistently.

Except I couldn't remember the last time I took a real breath. Or why my hands kept shaking. Or when I started keeping anxiety meds in both my car and desk, just in case.

Everyone praised my attention to detail, not realizing it was hypervigilance in a pencil skirt. They admired my preparedness, never seeing the 3 AM worst-case-scenario planning that made it possible. My performance reviews were perfect because perfection felt like the only safe option.

I wasn't managing anxiety. I was just managing around it. Turning insomnia into productivity. Masking panic attacks as bathroom breaks. Disguising hypervigilance as leadership qualities.

Today I finally understood: You can be drowning while everyone admires how well you swim. Your Google calendar can look flawless while your mind is in chaos.

So I'm learning something new: Being high-functioning isn't the same as being healthy.

1j943ur,mentalhealth,2025-03-11 22:51:30,How do you forgive yourself for the past?,"Hi everyone,

I’ve struggled with my whole life with my mental health (I’m 27F) mostly anxiety/depression from CPTSD. 

About 6-8 months ago, I started having lots of realisations and threw myself into changing my life and changing who I am in order to have a better future. This has been really difficult and one of the key things holding me back is I can forgive myself for who I used to be. 

I’m completely accountable for the mistakes I made which were largely a product of projections of how I was feeling about myself.

I was finally feeling on a good path and healing but I feel like I’ve gone backwards recently and anything that reminds me of my “old life” is causing panic attacks and thoughts of wanting my life to end and hurting myself as punishment. I never did anything that bad when you put it into perspective but I hate how I used to live my life and how I’ve hurt people I loved and it was like I had a veil over my eyes for so long. 

Has anyone got advice for forgiving yourself to finally move on? It’s like I’m being tortured by my own mind currently.

UPDATE: Thanks for all the encouraging comments and sorry to hear (but also comforting) others are going through the same. It’s been really refreshing reading different perspectives and I don’t want the rest of my life to be defined by who I was when I was struggling and doing my best. It’s a shame my best was a little shitty but i hope things will be easier.

I have been to 3 lectures since I have been at uni, I have half assed all my assignments, I don't say yes to plans, I lie to get out of things, I cry myself to sleep every night (morning since I fall asleep at like 8am).

my screen time everyday is like 11-18 hours. I spent all of that time scrolling, and checking to see if my boyfriend has texted me.

I have ZERO will to get out of bed in a morning. what the fuck do I do. do I end it? because honestly that's where I'm at. living a healthy life sounds annoying, why would I wanna get out of bed at like 8am to go for a walk? what am I even aiming towards?

She told me having thoughts meant I was going to do it and called 911. Before I knew it, they took me to the emergency room against my will.

They made me take off my clothes and made me put on a hospital gown, and I was forced to stay in the emergency room for the next 3 hours. They wouldn’t let me leave and give back my clothes until I spoke to the psychiatrist. They told me before I could speak to the psychiatrist, they had to take my blood and urine. They wanted to give me IV fluids because I looked dehydrated but I refused. I was perfectly capable of drinking water. I didn't want to be in the emergency room which was loud and crowded. When I spoke to the psychiatrist I said I wasn't thinking of killing myself and all the right things to get out. Then they forced me take a low dose of Abilify in their presence. Finally I was allowed to leave but they wouldn't let me leave by myself. I either had to have the ambulance drop me off or have someone pick me up. I agreed to be driven home by ambulance and then they gave me back my clothes.

I learned my lesson to never mention suicidal thoughts again. I grew up being told repeatedly that the US is a free country and all the freedoms we have, both by my parents and adults at school.

1jid36j,addiction,2025-03-23 23:34:39,The last birthday gift I gave my brother were pain pills,"The last birthday gift I gave my brother came in a small white box. 

Nothing frilly, just a box I had laying around at home. I didn’t gift wrap it or add a colorful bow. I simply wrote “Happy Birthday Joe” on a note, and left it in my mailbox, where he would pick it up early that morning.

All that mattered was my surprise gift inside. A small baggie of pain pills.

I wasn’t sure exactly what kind they were. Leftovers from prescription medications for various ailments, injuries and procedures.

My brother consistently complained about being in pain, all over his 50-year-old body, for reasons I was never clear about. His body was breaking down from living a hard life.

He physically looked like he was in pain. It affected his gait, his attitude, his every activity, I’m guessing. I couldn’t think of a better gift to give him. He later thanked me profusely.

I doubt that those pills lasted very long. Maybe a couple of days. Maybe just his birthday. He had an incredibly high threshold for pain pills and other substances.

A dose that would knock me out for the night would make him comfortably numb, I’m guessing. A euphoria I’ve never experienced.

I thought of my brother when I suffered a recent backache, of unknown cause. I just woke up one morning and it was killing me. I couldn’t bend over. I couldn’t twist around. It hurt to get into my car.

My instinctive reaction was to search through my medicine cabinet for any pain pills. I didn’t care what kind I had. I didn’t care what milligram level they were. I didn’t care if they were brand name or generic. I simply wanted the pain to end. I popped a couple of pills. The next day, I popped a couple more. My back pain eventually faded.

But the feelings I experienced haven’t faded away. I still think of my big brother and his pain. And all those people who are in pain or who believe they’re in pain on a daily basis.

According to data from the Centers for Disease and Prevention Control, the No. 1 way that prescription drug users improperly acquire opioids is from a friend or relative. Guilty as charged, your honor. This is exactly what I did with my brother on his last birthday.

I have lived a relatively pain-free life, though I’m currently experiencing knee, shoulder and wrist pain that is causing me chronic problems. My fortunate past has spoiled me and it has altered my judgment toward others who live in chronic pain. I too often lack enough empathy or compassion for them. This is easy to do when you’re not in pain every hour of every day.

Yes, I’ve made some healthy decisions in my life. And yes, I’ve been very lucky for my age, 62. Anything could happen to my health at any time, causing me serious pain and serious consideration about using pain pills on a regular basis.

My family history with painkillers and addiction leaves me rarely surprised about our country’s addiction to pain pills.

Can you imagine taking a handful of Vicodin in one day? I can’t. But my brother probably could have imagined it, and he possibly could take that many at once. I don’t know. Maybe one of your loved ones or friends could, too.

I once met a drug court client who told me he had such a high tolerance to pills, such as Xanax, that he could take between 10 to 30 pills in a 48-hour period, depending on his supply. The most pills he ever took in one sitting was 17, he told me.

Again, I wasn’t surprised. That interview came just four months after my brother died of a heart attack, related to his long-term drug abuse. At that time, I intentionally wrote about this issue to help me better understand his addiction to pain pills. Obviously, I’m still trying to understand.

To this day, though, I have no regrets giving him that birthday gift.",143,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/1jid36j/the_last_birthday_gift_i_gave_my_brother_were/,last birthday gift gave brother pain pills last birthday gift gave brother came small white box Nothing frilly box laying around home didnt gift wrap add colorful bow simply wrote Happy Birthday Joe note left mailbox would pick early morning mattered surprise gift inside small baggie pain pills wasnt sure exactly kind Leftovers prescription medications various ailments injuries procedures brother consistently complained pain 50yearold body reasons never clear body breaking living hard life physically looked like pain affected gait attitude every activity Im guessing couldnt think better gift give later thanked profusely doubt pills lasted long Maybe couple days Maybe birthday incredibly high threshold pain pills substances dose would knock night would make comfortably numb Im guessing euphoria Ive never experienced thought brother suffered recent backache unknown cause woke one morning killing couldnt bend couldnt twist around hurt get car instinctive reaction search medicine cabinet pain pills didnt care kind didnt care milligram level didnt care brand name generic simply wanted pain end popped couple pills next day popped couple back pain eventually faded feelings experienced havent faded away still think big brother pain people pain believe theyre pain daily basis According data Centers Disease Prevention Control 1 way prescription drug users improperly acquire opioids friend relative Guilty charged honor exactly brother last birthday lived relatively painfree life though Im currently experiencing knee shoulder wrist pain causing chronic problems fortunate past spoiled altered judgment toward others live chronic pain often lack enough empathy compassion easy youre pain every hour every day Yes Ive made healthy decisions life yes Ive lucky age 62 Anything could happen health time causing serious pain serious consideration using pain pills regular basis family history painkillers addiction leaves rarely surprised countrys addiction pain pills imagine taking handful Vicodin one day cant brother probably could imagined possibly could take many dont know Maybe one loved ones friends could met drug court client told high tolerance pills Xanax could take 10 30 pills 48hour period depending supply pills ever took one sitting 17 told wasnt surprised interview came four months brother died heart attack related longterm drug abuse time intentionally wrote issue help better understand addiction pain pills Obviously Im still trying understand day though regrets giving birthday gift

My daughters, 11 and 13, just got back in contact with their dad. He lost his parental rights in 2021 due to abuse and addiction. They contacted him for the first time since then on Feb 23 because his sister/their aunt had just passed from an accidental overdose. She was his best friend and I knew he wouldn’t be with us much longer after that. I just knew in my gut that it was going to send him over the edge. 

We saw him at the viewing and at the funeral on March 2 and 3, and it was really great for all of them, despite the circumstances. March 5 I text him and told him it would be ok for him to stay in contact with our girls via phone. They talked to him multiple times a day since then. 

On March 10, just one week after his sister’s funeral, he had been using while on FaceTime with our girls. They didn’t know what they were seeing when he went into overdose. They described it to me in detail a couple days ago. On Tuesday, they both said he wasn’t answering their calls or texts. I knew he was gone, but I told myself I was overreacting. I asked them through the day if they had heard from their dad, but it was always “No”. On Wednesday, it was the same. Wednesday night before bed, my 13 yr old said that her messages were no longer delivering and asked me if we could just go check on him. I told her no, and asked her to tell me first thing in the morning if he reached out to her. 

Thursday morning she told me her messages still weren’t delivering. I called the police that morning and asked for a welfare check. They went over and the door was locked, no answer, just the dog inside barking. The landlord let them in that afternoon, and at 1:46pm a detective called me. 

We’ve spent every day over at his house, my kids wanting to grab every piece of clothes he has recently worn, just to feel like he is close to them. I have no way to help them, all I can do is sit with them and cry together. I hate addiction, I hate opiates, I hate the pain they’re going through, the pain I’m going through. I hate the people who don’t understand and who just look at him as someone who was selfish and picked the drug over his kids, I hate the disease.

1jgvfpz,addiction,2025-03-22 00:01:39,Crack addiction graph,"

Hello,

Since the first day I smoked Crack ( Two years ago), it became a daily habit. There wasn’t a build-up, it just started and kept going. I lost a lot of money and became underweight. I dropped from 66 to 46 kilograms without even realizing it at first. I was working from home, which only made things worse. Even though my job required focus and mental sharpness, I still managed to get things done. Always last minute, somehow, but done. And that’s part of what made it dangerous. I could still perform. I could still deliver. So I kept lying to myself.

What I’ve learned is that no matter how smart I think I am, Crack is the way to hell. It doesn’t care how clever you are, how much potential you have, or how much you tell yourself you’re in control. It strips you down to nothing.

I managed to stop for a few days sometimes, but once I start again, I can’t stop. Especially with the person I was hanging out with. We were living together. I was the one who smoked it first, then we smoked together the next day. After that, it was part of the routine. Day after day.

We had a lot of problems. I was paying for everything. He couldn’t stop, not even for one day. He started acting differently. Lying constantly. The only thing he cared about was Crack. He was older than me by ten years, but I ended up being the one who took care of everything. Rent, food, damage control. It became chaos. And even though I could see it clearly, I stayed. I thought I was strong enough to handle it. I thought I could carry both of us.

I tried keeping my distance. Sometimes we would stop talking, or I would pull away, but it never lasted. We kept ending up back together. Not out of love or hope, but out of habit, out of guilt, out of that strange sense of responsibility I couldn’t explain.

Eventually, I decided to leave the city. I quit my job. Left everything behind. I spent the last six months far away. During that time, I started to feel like myself again. I ate properly, slept, and gained back over 15 kilograms. I looked healthier. I felt clearer. I thought I was done with that chapter.

But earlier this month, I came back. We saw each other again. And yes, we smoked a few times.

This time, it felt different. I didn’t even get high. All I felt was anxiety. A tight chest. Physical panic. There was no pleasure in it anymore. No illusion of escape. Just a harsh reminder that this thing still had a grip on me. And the worst part is, I already suffer from depression, anxiety, and ADHD. Crack makes all of that worse. It amplifies everything I try to manage. It replaces the high with a storm.

I don’t have trouble staying away from him now. I’m not attached in the same way I used to be. But I still worry about him. I still get thoughts like, “What if something happens to him?” Even though he did unforgivable things. Even though everyone tells me he’s just using me, that he talks badly about me, that he’s only ever taken and never given. Maybe they’re right. But I don’t hate him. I don’t love him either. I feel something in between. More like grief. not even grief for him, but for who I was around him I don't know maybe GUILT. I kept trying to be someone who could hold everything together. Someone who could fix what wasn’t theirs to fix.

I’ve always been assertive. Direct. But even with that, I’ve realized something uncomfortable. I might be too good to be true. I care too much. I give too much. Even when it’s breaking me.

I’ve started looking for a new job again. It’s been two weeks now. I’m trying to rebuild slowly, and I don’t want to fall back into what it was. I want to get back the life I had before I let all of this take over. But I know that the real recovery isn’t just physical or professional. It’s inside. It’s learning how to care without erasing yourself in the process.

I don’t know exactly what I’m asking here. Maybe nothing. Maybe I just needed to write this. Maybe you’ve been there. Maybe you understand what I mean when I say that the drug isn’t even the hardest part. It’s the role you play around it. The version of yourself you become to survive it.

Anyway, that’s where I’m at. I’ve been staring at this graph I made to track usage. It wasn’t supposed to be anything more than data. But now when I look at it, it feels like a journal. Like a confession. Every spike, every drop, it doesn’t just show how much I smoked. It shows when I started to disappear.

I’ve been using drugs mostly pills and (fentanyl towards the end of my addiction) for the last 18 years.

My exs mom was my plug and I was getting them dirt ass cheap.. so I always had a bag of oxys. That went on for 11 years. When we broke up I started taking whatever I could find.. morphines & Vicodin. A friend of mine gave me a bottle of bars 90 to get rid of well since I wasn’t getting the oxy anymore and the Vicodin wasn’t holding me I had restless legs, no sleep, vomiting and diarrhea. So one day I took a bar for the first time and I was able to sleep and I loved the feeling of it. I ended up taking all 90. That started my huge benzo tolerance! My habit became ridiculous. I remember my boyfriend showing me a picture he took of me sitting on the toilet without a shirt on and my lips were blue and I didn’t look right. I went hard asf on Xanax everyday. I was going thru 90ct bottle of farmas in a week. Now I don’t use anything other than cannabis sometimes for my pain (from my full back spinal fusion).

Is so few are ever willing to share about their addiction WHILE they're in addiction. I can guess why ... But why not? I do. I'll say straight up it's meth, too. If that's the condition I'm in, that's the condition I'm in. Such is life ... 



Some of us find ourselves depressed some days, happy other days, in the hospital some others days, or flat on our face naked in the middle of the street some others. Maybe at that point we're dead. If that's the condition we're in ... That's the condition we're in. Again ... Such is life.


I don't expect everyone to think this deeply and keep perspective, but we are on a ball floating through a vast billions of years old universe. I don't know who decided I was shit for a human because I struggle with ADDICTION, but, as you could probably guess, maybe some people need a better understanding of what that is, if you feel so inclined, or want to paint them a picture so they'll have a better impression of you. Fact is our brains have found something it believes is worthy of using to cope. It doesn't see the consequences of using it ... That takes the thinking part of our brain to figure out, right? It just knows this right here drug produces lots of dopamine and to remember it, so as to motivate me to return to it. 



But, ya know, *I'm* personally not so worried about people's petty judgements. I struggle with methamphetamine use disorder. I'm a meth addict. A chemsex addict, in fact. I'm an imperfect, messy, emotional creature just like everybody else. And I still have worth like everybody else. I'm a complex human being like everybody else. 




My meth use says the same thing smoking weed, drinking alcohol, smoking cigs, popping pills and doing psychedelics says about someone -- nothing. So they can go on and judge like it does, but I'm perfectly secure in who I am and who I wanna be, and can show a respect for people and their complexities.



Seems to me the reason a lot of people talk about being in recovery is because they enjoy wearing it as a badge of honor. That's cool. But I'm here to say I'm still in the madness, and that's ok too. I'm deserving of the same amount of basic respect as anyone else, and maybe I'll get my hard earned break someday as well. But just because I still struggle doesn't mean I should have to hide while I do, as though addiction were something to be ashamed of.

1jjwefy,addiction,2025-03-25 22:31:09,"losing my virginity to a hooker led to me spending majority of my life savings, cant even stop either","long story short, im 21 years old, and have spent the last 6 years of my life completely alone for the most part, i have no social life, i was the lonely loser in highschool that would hide in the bathrooms to kill time. i didnt ever get female attention, really i would avoid them for the most part out of insecurity. i still live with my family, but being the oldest out of my siblings i really felt eager to get financially free asap, i started putting most my life savings in the stockmarket as soon as i turned 18 and i stayed disciplined up until i was 20, i would do a lot of unnecessary stuff to save money, and it payed off i suppose, at my peak last year i had 50k saved up in stock equity (most i ever had)

https://preview.redd.it/bvqf8xcedwqe1.jpg?width=861&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=396499b9fb45cdf2b2e47b2030dbf8c45bf10eac

to add more context i was always addicted to porn, i had discovered it and frequently watched it in my middleschool years of my life and it went on until i was 20, then it started to get more severe, onlyfans starts spreading, its all that pops up on my feed now, so i give in, in total i probably spent like 4k-6k on OF i would rather not check but thats my closest guess. 

eventually my 50k networth at 20 gets closer to like 35k at the end of last year, because i also did help my family with their credit card debt and my part of the bills for the year

its now a week before valentines day in 2025 and im super sad one day for whatever reason i get the bright idea of finally losing my virginity to a hooker, i was already in the area, the first time i got scammed, the second time i finally lost my virginity! i felt a boost in ego, and wanted more immediately, in total my first week after finding where to go, i had already spent 2grand , i would tell myself stuff like, i wont let my account go lower than 30k, then it gets that low, now im saying 25k is my limit, it got so bad my 35k at the start of this year is now  only 12k as of today :(

[all that i have left now](https://preview.redd.it/b8xszqw6vwqe1.jpg?width=591&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=21b0930192f4142067dff7ccfb116756b4a4e7d7)

i think the first 3 weeks of doing this it was the excitement of sex that kept me going but then i started to gain attachment with just one regular hooker, and i would say thats what really started to get me to spend irrational amounts certain nights, sometimes i wish i never met her, but sometimes i hate to see her go, so i pay extra to stay with her longer, my porn addiction essentially translated to a sex addiction i would always go crazy amounts of rounds for no reason, it didnt hit me that wasnt normal until one day she, a hooker, called me a sex addict that kinda made me think after that day.

 i still regularly go to her and like i said its not even about the sex at this point i enjoy her presence we usually hang out in between rounds just talking while we smoke or get something to eat, i still get anxious around her but just the ease of having someone engaged enough to make me feel noticed feels good, really good, i cant let it go, and i dont even want to try and replicate it with anyone else i know its unhealthy and im just stuck in a money pit by paying for sex and company but ive just lost all motivation in life i guess

ive tried to get myself to go SAA meetings havent yet successfully gone, ive tried to get myself to confess to my mom and other family i sort of trust but overall i just feel it will be used against me so i continue to hold off or just say everythings fine if they ask whats wrong. it doesnt help that im basically unemployed as well eventually i wont have enough to sustain this addiction, everytime i tell the regular i go to that i wanna take a break i relapse, now nothing really is fulfilling enough to change what i have going on yet i guess, i still have life goals and stuff i want to do so these kinda things have been driving me crazy i never thought id let myself get this low. knowing ill have to work a couple years to make old progress again doesnt sit right with me, i want to change, just dont know where to go for help and honestly i feel defeated",29,28,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/1jjwefy/losing_my_virginity_to_a_hooker_led_to_me/,losing virginity hooker led spending majority life savings cant even stop either long story short im 21 years old spent last 6 years life completely alone part social life lonely loser highschool would hide bathrooms kill time didnt ever get female attention really would avoid part insecurity still live family oldest siblings really felt eager get financially free asap started putting life savings stockmarket soon turned 18 stayed disciplined 20 would lot unnecessary stuff save money payed suppose peak last year 50k saved stock equity ever add context always addicted porn discovered frequently watched middleschool years life went 20 started get severe onlyfans starts spreading pops feed give total probably spent like 4k6k would rather check thats closest guess eventually 50k networth 20 gets closer like 35k end last year also help family credit card debt part bills year week valentines day 2025 im super sad one day whatever reason get bright idea finally losing virginity hooker already area first time got scammed second time finally lost virginity felt boost ego wanted immediately total first week finding go already spent 2grand would tell stuff like wont let account go lower 30k gets low im saying 25k limit got bad 35k start year 12k today left think first 3 weeks excitement sex kept going started gain attachment one regular hooker would say thats really started get spend irrational amounts certain nights sometimes wish never met sometimes hate see go pay extra stay longer porn addiction essentially translated sex addiction would always go crazy amounts rounds reason didnt hit wasnt normal one day hooker called sex addict kinda made think day still regularly go like said even sex point enjoy presence usually hang rounds talking smoke get something eat still get anxious around ease someone engaged enough make feel noticed feels good really good cant let go dont even want try replicate anyone else know unhealthy im stuck money pit paying sex company ive lost motivation life guess ive tried get go SAA meetings havent yet successfully gone ive tried get confess mom family sort trust overall feel used continue hold say everythings fine ask whats wrong doesnt help im basically unemployed well eventually wont enough sustain addiction everytime tell regular go wan na take break relapse nothing really fulfilling enough change going yet guess still life goals stuff want kinda things driving crazy never thought id let get low knowing ill work couple years make old progress doesnt sit right want change dont know go help honestly feel defeated

I listened to the paramedics administer 3 shots of Narcan and do all they could to no avail. Unfortunately my husband passed away.  I was told from an investigator that he would have just felt like he was going to sleep and not been aware of what was to come. My husband fought a heroin addiction for many years but at the time there was legal conditions going on so he was going to therapy to regain his sobriety. He ended up relapsing and died from a mix of cocaine and fentanyl. I'm assuming that it what was the first thing he could get a hold of because he was never a fan of uppers. Following his death an investigator told me that my husband would have just felt like he was falling asleep and that it was completely painless. I'm writing this just to find out if that's true or not.

1jjzyk3,addiction,2025-03-26 01:12:50,I want to quit practicing addiction medicine!,"I've been practicing addiction medicine in some form for almost 26 years. Never in my career have I felt more defeated or wanted to quit as much as I do right now.

I have a patient I've known since she was 17. Over the years, she became more than just a patient to me; she felt like one of my daughters. Even after she moved out of state, we kept in touch regularly. Her mother and I tried everything we could think of to help her become sober and to keep her alive.

In my career, I've only worked with patients who've already chosen to become sober. That's who walks into my office. She originally came to me with her mother for help at 17. Every doctor said she was addicted to opioids, but no one wanted to help because of her age. For them, it was incredibly challenging, frustrating, and heartbreaking. But I gladly took her in. At the time, I had a concierge addiction practice which meant I had all the time in the world to spend with each patient. I helped her become sober from opioids. I remembered that the text messages between her, her mother, and I numbered in the thousands. She stopped the opioids but the cocaine and benzodiazepines continued. I sent her to counseling, psychiatry for her mental health, but she just wouldn't stop. I wouldn't fire her because I feared she would ultimately relapse and die from an opioid overdose.

She eventually moved out of state but we kept in touch. Recently, she went into an inpatient facility and became sober from everything. However, she was not taking methadone or buprenorphine. So, I feared she would eventually have a lapse and return to opioids or another drug. PAWS is a real thing and most clinics don't warn patients. She maintained 8 weeks of sobriety and her mind was starting to clear up. She started to realized how F up her life was. She started speaking like a mature adult and had goals. Everything started getting better. Wow was the thought on my mind every time we talked. But I was so afraid of that lapse.

Saturday, her mother sent me a text. She died from an overdose. The police believe it was from opioids based upon what they found. It’s seriously haunting me.

All of my appointments are audio recorded. I've been listening to them as I drive. Our conversations were like those I have with my own daughters. I find myself wishing that I'd spoken with her more, reached out more often, or said something different. But to be honest with myself, I can't imagine what I could have said to make things any different!! I am so angry right now. But I don't know what else I could have done. I don't know what I am going to say or do when I see the parents. They have to go without their 25 year old daughter. I still have mine. Life is so unfair and I can't continue to see young people die like this. As much as I want to quit, I know I have so many people depending on me right now to help them with their journey.

1j2ptdc,addiction,2025-03-03 18:37:49,Caught her doing meth again,"Both 43.  Have a good life, both have teenage kids (mixed family).  7 years ago found out she was doing meth/addys/heroine/pills, cancelled our wedding.  She went into treatment, etc, etc.  Stopped drinking.  She was getting the drugs from her cousin.  It was hard but we stayed together.

Had a hunch something was off in the last week, she was visiting an older handy man that helped out her mom's neighbors that I didn't have good feelings about.  Last night I went through her bags while she was taking a shower and found two pouches containing broken pens, lighters, foil, and two rocks of meth.  One pouch was in her purse and one was in her backpack.   She said she's smoking meth a few times a week.  I'm thinking everyday.   She hooked up with an old girlfriend that was supposedly clean but they ended up doing drugs a few years ago. She lost her mom 8 months ago, spiraled into depression.  So she's been doing this for a few years, at least that's what she's willing to give up.  She also got a prescription for Suboxone from a local treatment center at least a year ago, hid that from me as well.  Sounds like she's addicted to it.  She showed me last script was filled in August, hasn't filed since. Has quite a bit left, keeps it separate from the meth.

I asked her on Friday if she was giving this guy money or getting drugs, she got upset at me and denied it.  I can't trust anything she says now, again.   The anger is really coming on strong.  I'm placing the anger on this guy that was selling her drugs, I could easily take him out.  Obv not worth going to prison for, but I'm so angry.  I did submit anonymous tips with the local LEO, but not sure how serious they will take it.  I could contact the lady that lets him live at a house, still debating on that.  I just want him gone.  She knows she has to go no contact with this guy.  If they contact each other, then I will have no choice but to expose him to everyone in the neighborhood, which includes family.

She doesn't want me to tell anyone, especially her kids.  She said she can't deal with the embarrassment.  She didn't directly say she'd kill herself, but I expect she would.  Her dad committed suicide a day after her 21st birthday, so that fucked her up.

Not sure if this is a sign, but she sniffs her nose all the time.  Like it's almost a tick/habit she can't control.  I think she's congested, but I can't help but get triggered it's a sign of some type of drug abuse.

I told her she has to get into a therapy program.  I can't be checking her location and bank accounts all the fucking time again, it's just not how I want to live. She has a lot of money, so buying drugs or treatment isn't a problem.   She's an amazing woman, otherwise I wouldn't be dealing with this shit.  I just want her to not be so sad and thinking drugs are her only escape.  Ugh.

Any suggestions on how to handle this with compassion?  Thanks for reading.  I did tell my mother, as I had to tell someone.  I'm tempted to tell her brother but it would destroy her if she found out.

But I fought back. I’m still fighting.
What saved me wasn’t luck—it was structure. Routine. Mental rewiring.
I realized if I wanted to change, I had to reprogram how I thought and how I lived.

Here’s what helped most:

•Routine > motivation – Mornings and nights became non-negotiable

•Fitness – Boxing, resistance training, and movement changed my energy

•Mindfulness & journaling – Rewiring my self-talk and patterns

•Spiritual growth – Dispenza, NA, Māori wisdom—all tools to reconnect

•Service – Giving back gave me direction again

I’m not here to pretend I’ve got it all figured out.
But I’ve built something that’s helped me stay clean, get clear, and keep climbing.

1j3dvwt,addiction,2025-03-04 15:53:38,Stop Treating Addicts Like Helpless Shelter Dogs,"I need to vent. This is 110% my experience and beliefs....

I work in the addiction field, I’m an addict myself, and I’m in recovery. nothing makes me more mad than to see the way some people treat addicts—like we’re these fragile, helpless creatures who need to be babied, pitied, and enabled to death. I’ve seen it too many times: people excusing every single bad behavior, never holding addicts accountable, acting like we’re these poor little zoo animals that just can’t help themselves. It’s insulting. It’s infantilizing. And worst of all, **it keeps people sick.**

Addiction is brutal, and yes, people in active addiction suffer. But the whole ""Oh, you poor thing, life is so hard, let me shield you from natural consequences"" approach? That is truly a death sentence. Addicts don’t need to be handled with kid gloves—we need truth, structure, and accountability. Recovery isn’t about being shielded from reality and living in a bubble. It’s about learning how to live in the world and be accountable. It’s about facing the consequences of our actions, and making better choices moving forward.

Anyway, to mark the day I decided to get my first tattoo... 

It's a symbol for the Buddhist principle of The Here and Now.

Here's what it means...

You are the dot in the middle.

The water droplets going up and down represent time - one side your past, the other your future. They are reflections of each other, and grow larger as they move away from the present, just as the past and future grow murkier as they grow distant, becoming mixed with other memories and other possibilities. The dot in the middle is WHEN you are, at this very moment, the ""Now.""

The ripples in the surface are the physical space extending all around you, so the dot in the center is where you are, at this moment, the ""Here.""

I like to say that guilt is living in the past, anxiety is living in the future, and jealousy is wanting to be somewhere or something other than where and who you are.

To live without anxiety, guilt and jealousy, you need to be the dot, living in the Here and Now.",22,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/1jma1x4/got_out_yesterday/,Got yesterday Finished 5 weeks intensive outpatient yesterday actually didnt even know last day till group ending banded Anyway mark day decided get first tattoo symbol Buddhist principle Heres means dot middle water droplets going represent time one side past future reflections grow larger move away present past future grow murkier grow distant becoming mixed memories possibilities dot middle moment ripples surface physical space extending around dot center moment like say guilt living past anxiety living future jealousy wanting somewhere something live without anxiety guilt jealousy need dot living
1jfeudw,addiction,2025-03-20 02:32:47,"I struggle to sympathize with addicts I see as ""lesser"" and don't know how to feel.","I've been a poly drug addict since I was a teenager. Starting around 13 I was using multiple drugs once a day and by 17 to 20 I realized I had a problem with substance use. Daily use of Cannabis, Alcohol, prescription amphetamines, benzodiazepines, cigarettes / vaping and I would occasionally dable with prescription opioids, street fentanyl, cocaine, MDMA, Ketamine, psychedelics, and research chemicals. Currently I'm going through cocaine & alcohol addiction. I sniff about an eight ball and drink a handle of vodka everyday.

It's honestly indescribable how much mental and physical pain you're in when you've given up on life so badly you're willing to destroy your body to feel ""happy"" or numb.

I don't want to come off like some asshole who's ""gatekeeping"" addiction. I understand all forms of addiction whether it be substances, sex, gambling, food, etc can all have devistating impacts on a person's life when they get out of hand.

But... Does anyone else get kind of upset when they see people talking about stuff like ""masturbation addiction"", ""social media addiction"", ""exercise addiction"", etc? It can feel like people are glamorizing addiction, or manufacturing a problem for there identity.

I'm fully aware all of these are valid problems and have the potential to really damage your body, mind, and relationships but it can feel like these issues can really trivialize the word ""addiction"".

I understand it might be pretty hard and frustrating to not eat your favorite food or check your phone, but can you even imagine what its like to artificially boost chemicals in your brain to an unnatural level for years and then try to go back to living life normally? Once you feel the highest highs substances can offer it really deterites the pleasure of anything you can achieve naturally. Nothing will ever compare to being able to control and boost your mental state to an unnatural level no matter what the situation is or where you are.

1jehx9u,addiction,2025-03-18 22:31:06,Do you think your addiction was caused by mental illness?,"I feel like a lot of addiction (if not all) can at least partially be traced back to mental illness. This also makes me think that a lot of times when people say someone has an “addictive personality” they actually just have a mental disorder (most likely ADHD).

Here are two examples that I myself can relate to and I think a lot of others as well:

1. (ADHD) ADHD is often believed to be caused by a dopamine deficiency. This causes you to constantly feel the need for something that gives you that dopamine, or at least something that fills that hole. f.e. This can lead to a drug addiction so you finally feel good and satisfied.

2. (Depression) When you’re depressed, there’s often nothing that can make you happy. This can frequently lead to you laying in bed all day doing nothing or something that makes time seem to go by faster. An easy way to get some dopamine while laying in bed on your phone is to masturbate. This can easily lead to you getting addicted to masturbating since it’s the most accessible way to make you feel a little better.

These are just examples and probably not the best. You can insert just about any addiction in those examples, I’ve just picked some that I’ve personally had some experience with and seem some other people have experienced as well.

I have ADHD, depression and social anxiety disorder. I feel like I’m constantly cycling between addictions and I’m never truly sober (the times I’ve used the least amount of things, have been the times I’m the most suicidal and feel the worst). I constantly absolutely crave for something that makes me feel even a little better, anything from drugs, to excessively masturbating, to binge eating, to getting obsessed with a tv show and watching it 10+ hours a day.

Ps: I’m not talking about specifically using drugs as “self medication”. Although imo the distinction between drugs and medicine is very complicated.

After this I started going out doing bumps and lines one or two days and week with friends which quickly escalated to me going out drinking so much and blacking out, doing lines every minute or two and tweaking hardcore pacing around, talking non stop, giving hundred dollar bills to my friends out of nowhere and overall just being what I think might be manic. All my friends started to tell me to slow down, taking my bag away from me, and bringing me home early once I blacked out. I have slowed down and use it more responsibly and with control, I have stopped blacking out and do bumps at a normal pace but use almost everyday if I can afford. Today is almost a week straight, 2000 gone, and being high while I write this. I wanted to post this just to explain how I escalated insanely fast.

1jbuduo,addiction,2025-03-15 12:49:17,How I lost my soul mate after 10 years.,"
EDIT:I've uploaded a much more detailed version of this story....same truth, same addiction, just a lot more of a personal version I wrote just for myself and her to look at, that a few people asked me to share. View my profile if you'd like to see it.



I met the love of my life  when I was 18. We met online actually, in an instrumental/ karaoke discord. I would play piano in an empty channel to myself for a couple hours a day, maybe have somebody join for 30 seconds and leave without saying anything. One day I saw somebody sitting alone in their own channel and decided to jump in. She was playing ukulele, over the rainbow of course, I thought it was so insanely cheesy. But I stayed through all of it and said ""your play well, thank you"".. they then left the channel.

A couple days later I was doing my thing alone and the same person jumps into my channel instead....and we didn't stop talking for a single waking moment, for 10 years...

For the entire time I knew this woman she was the light of my life, my purpose for existing. I was suicidal before I met her, I was probably in those empty chat rooms hoping to just find some sort of help, somebody to listen. But instead I found the love of my life, and I betrayed her.

I was on pain killers from the ages of 13 to 20. I was in a bad accident as a kid and my doctor thought it was necessary then. But then the opiate crisis started and without warning they switched me to a bunch of different muscle relaxers, anti inflammatory stuff, you name it, everything except pain killers. 

(20 yrs old) It was really hard for a good year, my then girlfriend was really busy going through nursing school, and I was able to hide how much I was hurting quite a lot, I don't think she ever expected anything was wrong to be honest. Not to blame her at all, I hid the aches and pains and sweats in the beginning. And after the withdrawals left I just had to hide the pain. I probably popped 15 ibuprofen a day back then.. 

(26 years old)  I had the best time of my life with my partner for so many years, dozens of vacations and dinners and movies and countless upon countless nights spent up until 5 in the morning just because we didn't want to fall asleep and end our time together... 

And then I went to a routine doctor check up. I was working a new job at the time, on my feet 12 hours a day, constant lifting, the pain was bad. I told the doctor that, he gave me the same Yada Yada as always about inflammation and exercise and stretching..but at the end he mentioned something, kratom. Some all natural plant that had healing properties. I disregarded him, hippy type doctor, always telling me the cure to life is some plant or to stop eating msg. 

Jump forward a few months and I had to find a new job, last one just wasn't working out. One day a few weeks in im taking out the trash and a neighbor a couple stores down tells me to come over and try their stuff, it's awesome blah blah blah. He mentioned that same name as my doctor, kratom..I gave in and went over one day and they made me this awful, nasty, clumpy orange juice and green powder that refuses to mix with the liquid, death soup shot. Half an hour later, I was astonished, same exact feeling as the pain relievers I was on 6 years ago..

(28 years old)  I'm living in Texas now, with the best job I've ever had, potential to make over 100k a year with bonuses. With the best girl in the world, with prospects of having children and buying a home together. I've won over her mom, her dad, her grandparents, the whole family treats me like a son...but in the background...im wasting hundreds of dollars a week, buying 7hydroxie...a souped up super addictive version of kratom... my life is falling apart, im falling behind on bills to feed my addiction, I don't buy the love of my life a single Christmas present because I'm so behind on bills from wasting so much money...I owe 2000 on my car....

A couple weeks later I got arrested for failing to stop and provide my insurance when I bumped an empty parked car in a lot...I didn't notice any damage and just drove off...it was stupid and I payed the ultimate price for it...later that night when I finally was able to call her....she was distraught, totally inconsolable, telling me that she's going to kill herself for what I've done....she got into my car to move it and found my dozens of bottles...my stash of everything...the price tags were on the things...she told me just what was in the car was worth almost $1300...this was 2 weeks after Christmas...

She ended up bailing me out of jail, picking me up,  taking me home...and she sat down with me and told me she was in it with me, she was going to help me through this addiction, she wouldn't abandon me in my time of need. She came up coping methods to try and help me stay distracted from all of that bad stuff, encouraged my hobbies, she helped with everything. 

I was clean for less than a week before we had a fight late in the night..she had told me that this was so difficult, she had wished she never found out. She just wanted a normal beautiful life like we used to have.. I encouraged her to slap me, to wake me up and that I was going to try so hard to give her everything in the world...but after she went to bed I couldn't sleep, I paced for 5 hours back and forth...all I could hear in my head was her crying..telling me how hard I made this on us...all I could think to myself was im not good enough for her....so what does it matter anyways...so i took her credit card and went and bought more drugs.. then I raced home and pretended everything was normal...I took one and my brain was quiet for the first time since I felt her hand on my face... 

Later that day she was out with her mom and I got a call....she knew everything. She saw the bank charge, she saw me leave on our ring cam, she saw footage of me in the shop buying the drugs... the addiction, she would help me through , but this was like the 3rd or 4th time that I stole from her as well and she put it together that the times in the past were me as well..I never begged for another chance so hard in my whole life...I was out in the streets, living out of my car, lost my job...a week later a semi truck tboned me and my car was impounded. Truly homeless at this point. Another homeless person steals my bags of clothes, food, and blanket, a couple days later...

Im back in colorado now...I've been clean since the last moment I saw her... over 30 or 40 days I wana say...I tried to kill myself last night..she had called me out of the blue...and I had been planning to do it soon anyways so I figured..if I can die listening to her voice that would be pretty good...I swallowed 6 bottles of sleeping pills I had saved up over the last couple weeks while she was talking...she caught on when my words started to slurr and I told her what I did...at first I tried to hide from the cops she sent but hearing her wailing and crying was too much for me to take.. I waved over a cop and just remember puking my guts out... I really don't know what to do now...

We were each other's firsts loves...first everythings...hug, kiss, date, valentines, vacation...and for me she'll always be my last. Wether I end up living another 50 days or 50 years, she will be the last woman I ever touch, love, think about at night, and when I wake up in the morning... my life was truly ruined, stolen, ripped up into shreds, and stomped on...because I got addicted to a drug...please nobody follow my example....it leads to hell.

At the time I *felt* like I didn’t have a choice, because rehab indoctrinated me into believing that I had no choice, and also it was convenient for me to say “I have no choice; I have a trauma-related brain disease!” because I wanted to get high & avoid responsibility for my decision. 

I understand genuinely *feeling* powerless over addiction, but let’s be honest, we know how drugs work. We know they fuck with your mind. It’s not like I had no clue what I was signing up for when I decided to smoke a crack rock for the first time. 

That’s why I get confused when people talk about addiction as a ‘disease’ & they say it affects your neurology in such a way that ‘you feel like you need the drug to survive!!!’ 

OK sure, but you also KNOW for a fact that you DON’T need to smoke crack in order to survive. I could be high as fuck on crack & it doesn’t make me oblivious to the reality that crack-cocaine isn’t like water & it’s not actually essential for survival. 

So even if I strongly feel like I ‘need’ to buy & smoke more crack, I KNOW that I do not IN REALITY have that need. It’s just a drug-induced feeling: I feel like I ‘need’ crack only because I’ve been smoking crack, which fucks with my perception of what I need & causes me to feel like I need things that I do not, in fact, actually need. 

I knew that all along. I’m not stupid. I smoked crack on purpose. It was my choice. I chose to be a crack addict. 

Why? To get high. I loved getting high on crack. 

Why did I keep doing it despite the damage it was causing to my life? Because I was irresponsible & chose to prioritize the short-term pleasure of a crack-high over anything else that actually mattered & added fulfilment to my life. 

…I just used crack as an example, I could say the same thing for meth or benzos or alcohol or other drugs. 

TLDR — I’m sick of people assuming I’ve never been through addiction just because I don’t subscribe to the “addiction is a trauma-caused brain disease that makes you powerless over your choices” belief. It’s a choice. The feelings of powerlessness are an illusion and/or a convenient excuse to continue your addiction.

1jg2q9n,addiction,2025-03-20 23:18:44,I wrote this song about my girlfriend a week ago. She passed away from a drug overdose the same day I was supposed to come show it to her.,"It still doesn't feel real that she's gone. She was the love of my life. My best friend. My soulmate. She was my first love and highschool sweetheart. We broke up and went our separate ways, then reconnected 7 years later in our late 20's. We were together for about 3 years after reconnecting. We're both addicts and this past year has been hell for both of us, especially her. Constantly struggling to stay clean. Living on the street. Putting her through so much trauma due to almost dying to overdoses myself. Just pure chaos. I finally got clean a few months ago and am currently in a recovery house. Her birthday was on the 15th. That's the last time I saw her. I was supposed to show her this song then but we didn't have enough time for me to play it so I planned to show her the next time we saw eachother. The day we planned to meet up is the same day she was pronounced dead. I have so much guilt for the role I played in this all. Now it haunts me that I didn't show her when I had the chance on her birthday. We were supposed to get clean together and get married and live a life together. Start a band. Travel the world. Grow old together. I don't know how to cope with this pain it is absolutely unbearable. I've been through some things in my lifetime but this tops it. I lost my soulmate. I miss her so much.

I know this sub isn't for sharing music but I felt it was a good opportunity to vent about the situation and the context surrounding the song is relevent. It is horrifically sad timing to have lost the love of my life the same day I was so excited to sing this song to her. It's also unbelievablely sad given the fact that the song is literally about being by her side and supporting her until she can see her way out of the addiction she was trapped in. It all feels like the sickest joke the universe could've played on me. I've reached out to family and people I concider supports in my life. I'm still processing everything. It all just feels like the worst nightmare and I'm just waiting to wake up from it. Her name was Sierra and I adored her in every way.

The video I posted is a rough version with a few slip ups and my ukulele was out of tune. It hurts too much right now to keep playing it so this version will have to do. Please don't let the fact that I'm grieving stop y'all from giving honest criticisms of my playing or the songwriting, however harsh they may be. I'm curious what others think about my music, especially fellow musicians.

TL;DR: I wrote this song about my girlfriend who, since writing it, has passed away and never got to hear it. I'm curious what others think of it.

Here are the lyrics:

""Stop The Bleed""

You've been sitting in the dark for far too long
Eyes adjusted, spirit rusted, same sad song
Familiar voices wait to comfort you into the wrong
Way too bright when I hit the light cause you're too far gone

So I'll sit in the dark with you
For as long as you need
And I'll play this guitar for you
Until we're finally able to see

Our way out of this mess that I've created 
So many nights that I know you spent up waiting
All the time wasted, can't help but hate it
Apology belated, so I'll just save it
I ran through the muck with your love need to face it
Pushed all my luck how the fuck do I say it
That all this time wasted away and I hate it
It's too late for sorry now, so I'll just save it

But I'll sit in the dark with you
For as long as you need
And I'll play this guitar for you
Until you're finally able to breathe
Able to breathe x3

With all that's been said 
And all that's been done
You've still got my heart
You're my only one 
I'd walk a hundred miles
If it meant something to you
Do anything 
If I could just find a way to

Stop the bleed x3
You'll be able to breathe once we finally
Stop the bleed x3
I'll be able to breathe once we finally
Stop the bleed x3

1j9hxr2,addiction,2025-03-12 11:32:03,My stepfather overdosed today,"Today is the day that my (28 M) stepfather (47 M) died of a heroin overdose. Since the age of 14, he has been in and out of mine, my brothers (21 M) and my mothers (46 F) life. Him and my mum also had twins (6 F). 

For the majority of his and my mums relationship, he has been an alcoholic, where my mum has broken up with him more times than I can count due to his drinking habits and cocaine use.

She had been with him for around 15 years, and it was mostly him lying about not drinking and taking drugs as it lead to him losing jobs, spending money from a joint bank account and disregarding any type of responsibility he had.

He also had been given around 100k of inheritance money and didnt work for 2 years, spending all the money on drink, drugs and takeaways etc.

Overall, he wasn't a bad person, but was controlled by addiction and he had brought my mum down with him. My mum is currently studying for her masters and has a good job, her own home and has done really well for herself, but has been trying to combat his addiction for over a decade and a half. So I feel for her right now as she's done everything she could to try and help him.

He was due to get a government property in the next few months so my mum was housing him until then, but 2 weeks ago he left by his own choice as he was willing to sleep on the street for drink and drugs and it wasn't until 3 days ago that we found out he had been using heroin after mixing in with a certain group of people.

My mum said that the girls will be waiting for him for when he beats his addiction last night and she didn't get a text back.

Today we found out that he died of a heroin overdose this morning. I wouldn't say that he was a father figure to me, as he came in late in my life, but he was to my brother and of course, my twin sisters, so maybe thats why I dont feel as distraught as they do, but I do feel sad to think what was running through his mind at the time of death.

When we found out that he was using heroin 3 days ago, I was saying to my mum that I was going to drive round to the place he was staying and try to take him away, but now its too late. I never expected this to happen so quick.

This is a brief overview of his life and addiction and there is alot more to it.

I would just like to say that if any of you guys are in the same boat that my stepfather was in, and you have people trying to pull you out of addiction and also love and care about you, please try everything in your power to take that offer to get out of it.

I can't imagine what his state of mind was in at the time this has happened, but I do feel very sad for him and most of all, my twin sisters who will now grow up without a father.

My whole family is hurting..

1jdx6iu,addiction,2025-03-18 04:40:02,The “chronically-diseased-addict-in-recovery” mentality,"People get themselves addicted to alcohol/drugs, it causes problems, so eventually they seek ‘help’…Maybe they go to AA/NA, maybe they go to rehab, maybe they’ll see a drug counsellor, maybe all of the above…Either way they’ll be taught that their addiction is some sort of spiritual/medical ‘disease’ and it’s ‘chronic,’ so they’ll never get over it. In fact they should go to Meetings on a regular basis and repeat the mantra: “Hi, I’m X, and I’m an addict.” 

Does this work very often? Does doing this shit help people stay sober? **No.** Maybe 1 in 10 people go to rehab and/or Twelve Steps and actually love that quasi-religious recovery cult, and that’s the solution for them. But for 9 out of 10 people, this is toxic bullshit. 

Living with the “chronically-diseased-addict-in-recovery” mentality is depressing and miserable for most people.

Anyway I’m 20f with high functioning aspergers and a extremely addictive personality. After that I turned what was fun with friends to everyday. I’m currently cut down to 3 days a week but

My point is when I do coke I just drink and cry and whine and feel sorry for myself, alone or with my family (who aren’t aware I’m going to the toilet to sniff ) I feel just as bad when I’m not I guess but I don’t cry unless I do coke. It’s ruining my life and I don’t even like it. Idk maybe its easier to point at the coke and say this is why I’m crying this is the bad thing.

1j6wu3s,addiction,2025-03-09 01:50:58,My mom is 21 years sober and started ketamine therapy,"I really don’t know how to feel about this. 

I was in 8th grade when my mom uprooted her life, moved 12 hours away from me and went to treatment. That was 21 years ago and she’s been sober ever since - not a drink or a drug outside of pain killers for major surgery until now. 

Her and my step dad started the ketamine therapy awhile back to work through some deep rooted trauma they couldn’t get to via talk therapy. My step dad (20 years sober) lost his job shortly after and they continued doing it therapeutically to process everything. 

I totally get the motivation to explore different approaches to therapy, but what makes this shocking is that my parents aren’t just sober they’re like fully immersed in recovery.

1j4nsbu,addiction,2025-03-06 04:53:09,Wife of an addict: I don't know what to do,"I feel like I'm starting to spiral and didn't know where to reach out. No one else knows. 
I discovered my husband's addiction a week after we got married. Something just seemed 'off'. We went on a trip down south right after our wedding, and all he would do was sleep. Like all day. And on the flight home, he had (what I see now was probably) a seizure of some sort. It scared the shit out out me, but I never made the connection. A few days later, I had this gut instinct to check his laptop. His Google maps timeline. This was back when you could connect your phones timeline to other devices. 
Part of me wishes I didn't. Trips to questionable neighbourhoods at 4am, 5am, to cheap hotels or apartment buildings. I thought he was cheating. I was an absolute mess. I called him and told him to come home. By the time he got home, I had his bag packed and told him he either needed to tell me what he was doing or he needed to just leave. And at that moment, I felt strong. I told myself I would make him leave regardless. I was sure he was going to tell me he was cheating. 
When he comes home, I ask. And I honestly did not even consider the possibility of addiction. But that's when he tells me he's been battling an addiction to meth. My world felt like it flipped upside down. The man I love more than anything in the world, the strong one, the smart one, the man I plan on having children with... I forgot all of my strength and just caved into his words about wanting to stop, trying to stop on his own, and suddenly feeling a sense of relief that I knew - so he would have a renewed reason to quit. 
I never made him leave. I believed him. 
Since then, it's been a relapse every few months. I travel for work, and now it's like clockwork.. I leave for work, and he will relapse. He doesn't know how I know, but I check his phone after my work trips. And I hate that I have to do it - I've never checked any previous boyfriend's phone, but I feel like this disease has created a new side of me that I HATE that I have to do this, but I also know I need to see what's going on.
I'm away on a work trip right now and even though I can't confirm he's relapsed, I feel it. I love this man more than anything but I honestly don't know what to do anymore. I'm losing my hair from the stress, and I'm so concerned about what happens when/if we have children and I need to leave them at home with him when I travel. 
He said he's open to therapy, hesitant but open. But what does that even look like? Can that work? I feel like I'm swimming so far out of my depth here, I just know I can't fix him on my own.

1j01th1,addiction,2025-02-28 06:56:18,I’ve never truly wanted to stop using drugs and alcohol,"I’m sure many people in here can relate. I have done drugs my whole life. It’s basically been the foundation of who I am. Have an older brother who is a recent recovering addict who had me smoking weed and drinking when I was 9. Doing cocaine at 14. And I eventually stumbled into heroin on my own at 22. I was a needle user for about 2 years. Went to rehab several times. Relapsed several times. Sobered up for the most part for a few years. I’m 34 now. 2 years ago after several years clean I was on a work trip and just so happens the coworker I was with was a heroin addict. Of course I use with him and knowing it was fent, overdose immediately. Wake up in hospital with tube in my throat and wife in front of me. I have 2 kids at home at this point. But the minute opportunity to use was in front of me I knew I was going to do it. I fake like I’m not but deep down I know. Anyways, I haven’t used heroin since. But I’ve smoked weed and done cocaine. In fact, I’m on cocaine right now. Idk what’s wrong with me but I don’t really feel shame. My wife and 3 kids are sleeping and I am up doing cocaine and drinking. I enjoy being fucked up very much. The only way I don’t do drugs is if I just stay home and be somewhat unhappy. I’ve done many years of therapy. But I’ve never truly told myself I’m an addict or that I’ll never do drugs again because deep down I know I will.   Because I want to. Because I have a “good time” and I’m kinda like fuck it, life is not that important or serious. I’ve managed to get a good job and have a good life due to my stints of sobriety. I don’t want to lose those things. But I also don’t want to give up using drugs and alcohol. When people around me, like my brother, get sober it kind of blows my mind. Like why pigeon hole yourself to that life. I basically get super close to demolishing my life before I stop and that seems to be working out. I know, I know, it won’t forever.

1jk4xfx,addiction,2025-03-26 05:50:57,My Life Is In Ruins,"Let me just start off by saying that my now ex girlfriend/baby mama (31F), and I (34M) are cocaine addicts. It has completely destroyed our lives.

I've been using for about 4 years, and she has been using for about 12 years. The last 2 have been the worst of my life.

I started to lose control when my grandma's (the woman that raised me) health started to decline severely. When she died 2 years ago, I went into a grief spiral, and completely nuked everything.

The following is what I've been through in just the last year alone:

-5 pinks slips
-3 job firings
-2 break ups w/ my baby mama (yesterday was the second time)
-1 accidental cocaine overdose
-1 fetty lace overdose
-1 apartment eviction
-2 inpatient rehabs
-1 sober living (Got kicked out for relapsing)

I'm so fucking tired of this shit. I hate it. So much. It has taken nearly everything from me. In the last 24 hours, it has cost me my job, and my relationship.

She was everything to me. I fought so fucking hard for her. Harder than I've ever fought for anyone, including myself. She was my person. My soulmate.

The drugs changed us both. It stole our attention away from everything that mattered. We were best friends, partners, and lovers.

I have gotten better with my usage, but her's has gotten so much worse. It's taking her mental health to extremely dangerous places. We are both toxic individuals, and it's worse in our relationship. We both just keep triggering and enabling each other.

I hope that one day we will get sober and healthy, and we'll have a chance to try again. Staying together now will only hurt or kill each other.

I'm trying to focus on myself and my sons, but it's still fresh. If not being with me saves her life, then I will gladly sacrifice what I want. This is hard. She was the love of my life. The only woman that ever made me feel seen, heard, and understood. She made me feel unconditionally loved.

I know I have to let her go to save us both, but I love her so fucking much. Things have to get better from here. This is my last chance to save myself.

Man... it was nice and I'd be lying through my teeth if I said I didn't miss it. Somewhere in my mind it tells me it wouldn't hurt to do it just one. more. time. but weirdly enough every single relapse I've ever had started with ""just one more time"".

I think I'd be getting myself back into a bad situation. Then I think back to all the ""worse than death"" stuff that came with addiction and almost immediately I'm like ""nah"" lol. But man... the temptation is STILL somehow so strong. Crazy how you'd choose drugs over yourself, a warm meal, a home, a family, shit even your own kids if it gets bad enough.

 tell my therapist that I wish there was a HUD of sorts to alert me when I'm about to fuck up but of course, there isn't any.

1jdnbl3,addiction,2025-03-17 20:46:01,Addiction is not a chemical dependency,"
Addiction is not just a lack of will power

Addiction is not a disease in a way you've been told.

Addiction is a reality loop. A subconscious identity lock that traps people in a self re-enforcing cycle of experience. It is not about substances, it is about energy imprints that has been coded into the nervous system. Until you break the loop at its core, no amounts of therapy, rehab, or discipline will eliminate it.

The hidden truth is addiction is a self perpetuating identity pattern. The reason addiction feels inescapable is because it locks itself into the subconscious as part of an identity construct. Once an identity is installed, the brains reticular activating system works to confirm it in absolute reality. This is why people relapse. It's not the substance that pulls them back. It's the programmed identity. 

What was never told. You don't fight addiction, you erase and re write the identity framework that makes it real.

When the subconscious blue print of addiction collapses, the behaviour disappears effortlessly. 

Instead of enforcing behaviour change, you reconstruct your identity at the root level so addiction no longer belongs to the person.

You don't overcome addiction, you become someone whom addiction is no longer a possible reality.

Now read that again.

I might just be goin crazy, who knows. I'm starting to feel discouraged and depressed. I know my girl needs me to find a job so she can move back in with me when she gets custody. There's nothing in the world that i want more then for her to move back in so we can be a family, but I feel like I'm falling short. Like I'm letting her down. I feel like I'm stuck in square 1 and all I need to do is find a job to get out.. I hope my prayers are answered soon.

I had a relapse. It does NOT change or takeaway my progress. I know exactly why I relapsed, I know the exact dominoes of thoughts and actions that I did to make the decidion to relapse.

That means I also know how to stop it and redirect the energy.

That's life, you fall. Just get back up, right your wrongs and be even more ferocious my brothers.

1jf88mw,addiction,2025-03-19 21:23:51,"Am I addicted, or do I just have no impulse control","I have never really considered myself to have a problem with weed, and I didn't even consider it to be something that could be addictive. However, since trying edibles in 2022, I kind of just didn't ever stop. Like, for the past 3 years, aside from a few month or couple week long breaks here and there, I have generally taken edibles 2-5 times a week on average, sometimes every day for a week or two straight, without fail. Now, I also can't really contribute what problem in life to what, there are too many complicated factors, but I do know since 2020 when I graduated, gradually to now, somehow I have gone from being 18 and having literally 0 problem with impulse control, easily saving several thousand dollars, to now at 22 struggling to keep my bank account with any money in it at all. My previous relationship, starting in 2020 to 2024, also was perfectly fine till about 2022/2023, when we started fighting a lot. I also had decent grades my first year in school, till dropping out of college TWICE, in 2023, gap year, and then this year again. I don't really know, it all just kinda fell apart, but is it weed, depression, relationship troubles, lack of friends and things to do, some combination is beyond me. 

But recently I have struggled to get hired anywhere, despite multiple applications and interviews, even with people who claimed to be desperate for workers, or who even claimed I was a great fit in interviews. I do have more time on my hands, am more bored, sure, but I have recently begun to do more and more drastic things to get my hands on edibles. 

First, my financial situation is easily the worst its been. I am 7 or 8k in debt, multiple toll payments, a parking ticket, college debt, credit card debt, and when I tell you I could literally care less about paying these things off, when I get my hands on 10 or 20 dollars somehow these days, it goes to weed, period. Any change for some gas to get around a bit. Normally I would buy edibles up to 3 or 4 times a week sometimes even, but I always was making at least around as much back, or more. 

Now?

In the last month or so I have

\-asked my dad for the remainder of my money, for gas, like literally 60$, that I gave to him LITERALLY for the safekeeping of MYSELF, in a moment of strength, a while ago. 80% went to edibles. 20% was for driving to them

\-asked to borrow 20$ from my grandparents for gas, and again like 3$ of that actually went to gas. Nothing crazy but still an uncharacteristic thing for me to do.

\-stolen any money hidden in peoples rooms in my houses. Replaced my brothers cash with a iou, stole my parents change jar, dug through any change container.

\-literally shoplifted some crap called 7oh and vodka when I couldnt steal any edibles when i was particularly bored and just didn't want to be sober. Isn't even the first time recently, Ive stolen gum, a charger, a few things that I just simply can't afford rn when I only get the occasional influx of a small amount of money I immediately want to get high with. This is one of the most concerning for me because I grew up a very strict christian, and while my morals have shifted heavily over the years, I have NEVER thought seriously about stealing and thought it was wrong, and at this point I literally just dont gaf anymore. Wasnt even nervous about it. If there were packs of edibles sitting out at stores like alcohol is, itd be game over lol.

\-have wanted to go on a trip i planned a bit ago to see my cousin, just need like 100$. Well, I decided to sell all my old video games I dont almost ever play to get money, wouldnt want to if i didnt need, but desperate times... I made 70$. Not bad, had another thing or two I could sell the next day, should be alright. (Well If I had just saved ""my"" money for the last month id be alright but no, I just get 10$ over and over and say screw it.) I told myself, I wont buy any weed unless im fs I have enough for the trip and extra. Well, I just drive by it and say screw it, Ill be wasting gas if I dont get it now. I then decide instead of one little pack, lets pay a little more for the 30$ pack and be good for a while. Then Im in the car and I all the sudden realize what I just did. Like, I very likely wont have enough money at all for the trip now. Because I couldnt simply have enough patience to wait. Like wtf is wrong with me lmao.

As far as anything else goes, its not like I am drastically more irritable on days when im sober, and there wasnt too many significant differences on long breaks either. My tolerance gets insane btw. Im not kidding you at one point i worked at a depressing factory and I have casually eaten a jar of like 8000mg (shitty d8 stuff but still) and just worked like normal. A little high. Ill regularly get up to that level, where one purchase is ONE high. Cause I cant just wait like 1-3 weeks. Its bad. BTW i have actually noticed some slight nausea several days after getting high a lot in a row, then stopping. I will say it could possibly be aimlessness and boredom. I am extremely dissatisfied with my life as it is, no real great plans, and no friends or groups to join. I have a good job where Im moving away soon which will help, but yeah rn Ill do whatever. It is a genuinely good thing I dont have any dealer friends, as annoying as thats been in the past, because straight up if I can look a drug up on google and people will tell me it wont kill me, fuck it ill try it. No joke, cocaine sounds super fun, DMT too, acid bring it on.

1jf2irl,addiction,2025-03-19 17:28:44,Active addiction is back.,"Hello, I hope this text finds everyone well. It took almost a year of hard work, dedication and consistency for my neuropathways to turn from a highway of hell to a deer trail. I kicked the shit, the drink, the smoke, everything. Completed 3 months of in/outpatient treatment, lived in sober housing, attended meetings everyday, involved with sober community as much as I can. I made it to 10 months of honest sobriety. Then I smoked a cig (personal choice to classify it as an abused substance), then bought a pack, then took a psilocybin gummy, then took it every other day, then I thought, ""one beer wouldn't hurt"". It didn't hurt, but making that choice, it loosened a discipline screw, as if to say ""promises that I make for myself don't matter"". Then I hit a dab pen. Then I made a routine of enjoying 3 tall boys each night while in a sober house (in my room). The dopamine created an illusion of a grand ol time. Instant stress reliever too. Lazy. Then I got a job at a bougie bar (because the tips are great). First job of my ""sober"" lifestyle. At this point, I still haven't changed my original sobriety date. Mind you, even though I was spiraling, my life was extremely productive. Full time student, gym 6 times a week, volunteering, pursuing passions (acting, modeling, art). Never had so many healthy relationships in my life. So l, i started getting some money under my belt and decided to move out of sober living, with a buddy of mine from rehab (who had relapsed already). The day that I packed the uhaul van and drove it off the driveway for the last time, i immediately asked my buddy to get an 8ball. We got fucked up. I didn't sleep for 2-3 days. Was stuck in a loop of satisfying the wildfire of my serial urges. Tinder, porn, massage parlors. At the beginning of the comedown, I realized that all of those ""missions and quests"" which I had been on the past 2 days to satisfy my urges were pointless. Paranoia, fear, feeling of impending doom had set in, and everything beneath the surface of my skin was trapped in a purgatory. Hell. Literally. It was a dejavu, because for 5 years I was a meth addict with a fetish for sleep deprived and drug induced psychosis. I found myself being overcome by the same emotional paralysis and absolute devastation which had been the catalyst to get sober in the first place. After eventually sleeping for 2 days, I woke up. Doom was gone, I was well rested (somewhat), sun was shining, squirrels were hurrying nuts, everything was back to normal. The relief was immense. I knew I had fucked up, and now I needed to correct the course. After all, I am aware of all the truthful clichés in AA, and knew that there was a way back to redemption. Over the next month, I found myself slowly sinking. Tallboy turned into a Sixpack, Sixpack into a twelver, and twelver into another twelver.. All within a 14 hour period. Secrets, shame, guilt, anger, sadness, started to pile up within, as I held on to denial with honor and even some sort of awareness. It turned into a me against the world. I became a stranger and people became stranger. Although, I held on to some principles I've learned, and made sure to maintain my responsibilities as to not prove correct the often mentioned phrase - thanks to addiction,  I lost everything in my life. (Paraphrasing) By the end of December, all I did was study, work, drink and fuck my new gf, whom I declared my loyalty and absolutely love to in a state of a drunken euphoria, and made sure to be really convincing, for the sake or personal comfort. She was/is in the program too, struggling I might add. I made her look like frigging Bill himself. I became desperate and depressed as fuck. Destructive, angry. An opportunity came along to go abroad and live with my family for the winter quarter. It was perfect because I needed a hard reset. Bought a one way ticket, and got a sense of relief. I'm not as hopeless and stuck as I thought. Anyway, let me go grab a 12 pack before the store closes.. you know what, let's make it 2, and 4 Tallboys. I never made it to my flight the next day. I woke up 2 days later, on my floor, by myself, having suffered at least one seizure (I'm epileptic and can recognize post seizure symptoms), phone had 50 missed calls from my family, because I never arrived there and Noone could reach me. It was surreal. I didn't know what was going on. Absolutely fried. Made it on a plane the next day.. Finally, the light at the end of the tunnel. Surely, being on a different continent will allow me to reset, get my shit straight, drop the habits again and focus. Well, even though it has been a spiritual experience like I intended, the abuse technically got worse. Since being here for 2 months, I've begun to use meth again, drinking like an elephant, engaging in risky behavior (sexual and otherwise). So, as I sit here right now, on day 2 of no sleep, smelling like coconut oil, lube and burnt meth, trying to control the circumference of my eyeballs so that I don't look like ... a crazy person, wondering how my favorite pornstar of the day is holding up without my intense supervision of her performance as I type this, while plotting on ways that I can inspire or win over an escort to give me a session on the house, or what specific series of words I need to use to convince a woman on tinder to be my personal pornstar for the night, or...ah  you get the gist, I am genuinely beyond scared, just like a front line soldier who is numb to the chaos and atrocities, because I am gaslighting myself about the fact that I have a serious issue. Meth isn't the same thing as eating a KitKat on your cheatday from the gym, I can't just run it off and be scot free from circumstances especially with my epilepsy. I need help but I don't feel desperate enough to admit the seriousness of what's going on with me. I'm so fucking depressed. So much on my mind I have to get it off my chest. What would my granny say if she saw me snorting death. 

God, grant me the serenity, to accept the things I cannot change, courage to change the things I can and the wisdom to know the difference. God, thank you for blessing me with another day on this beautiful planet and with a will to fight. Even though it is a dark time right now, it is happening for a reason. It has to be. Show me the way. Allow me to be the light amongst darkness. Place me where you need me to be. 

Thank you for allowing me to vent. 
With much love, appreciation and gratitude,

Yours truly,

1j2agph,suicidewatch,2025-03-03 04:25:32,I was raped by my coworker/friend’s husband last night. I can’t stop thinking about ending it all.,"Title pretty much sums it up. Have a coworker that I clicked with. Went over to her house and had some drinks and danced. My friend went to bed. Shortly thereafter, her husband got on me and started taking my pants off. Then started to rape me. I said no and that I didn’t want this. Tried to push him away. He wouldn’t stop. He finished without protection.

I’m absolutely horrified. I have no one to talk to about this. I’ve been sitting in bed sobbing all day. I feel so fucking gross and disgusting. I can’t shake the anxiety. I feel like I’m about to have a nervous breakdown. I managed to go to the store and got Plan B. I was already feeling very depressed lately but after this whole ordeal, I feel like taking myself out really sealed the deal for me. 

Also I’m gay and have a girlfriend of 7+ years and I’m horrified to tell her. She will be so upset. All of this is too much to handle. I can’t function right now. 

The friend/coworker of mine also has two little girls with this guy. I know it’s the right thing to do, but a report would probably absolutely shatter their family. They have their parents from out of the country that are moving in with them soon. If I spoke up I’d ruin everything for them. Then I’m worried about how I’m supposed to work with the coworker with a straight face and act like everything if fine. Then I’m worried that I’m fucking pregnant… there’s no way I can take care of nor want a child this time in my life. I also couldn’t carry my rapists child. That absolutely haunts me. I didn’t want any of this to happen. I wish I could reverse time. I’m at a complete loss and I’m totally broken.

1jja21v,suicidewatch,2025-03-25 03:18:05,"I don't want help, I don't want support, I want to be dead","Frankly, the only thing that's stopped me is the fact that I don't have a gun. Every other method I could think of would hurt too much, and I don't know how to die of cO poisoning.

High school isn't enough, apparently. Nothing is. Nothing will ever fucking be enough, especially not for my parents. I finally find out i have ADHD and you wanna know what my dad says?

(To doctor) ""Can you tell (OP) that this isn't an excuse?""

An excuse. A fucking excuse. I've been submitted to the hospital for suicidal risk, before, mind you. And after failing summer school and graduating at fucking adult school, college is next. Because sure, let's go to school again. Fucking shoot me.

But without college, I'm destined to live like a workhorse for the rest of my life. Like my parents. That's what they always tell me. You'll be like me, you'll be like me, you're doing this to yourself, puta huevonada.

The work week is bullshit. 40 hours a week, 8 hour days, and for what? To recover your sanity and go to bed before doing it all over again? 5 days a week. Because simply being alive isn't enough to deserve to live. Some people talk mad shit about fucking fetuses ""deserving to live"" while leaving the people who need their help to rot.

The world wants me dead. God wants me dead. Trust me, there's no question. I'm fucking nonbinary and afab, I'm destined to die. I'm being laughed at. Mocked. And for what? What greater purpose could possibly be worth this bullshit?

I don't want to recover. Therapy is useless, I'm stuck with my fucking parents who I'll never do enough for, never suffer enough for, and when I die I bet their arrogant asses will say I had every chance. Yeah. Because I'd fight to live in a world that clearly doesn't want me. And therapy can't change that. Nothing I do can change that.

Every time I fight, I'm rewarded with more bullshit. No matter how many times I get back up, I get knocked down. I'm fucking stupid for ever getting back up. I wish I died years ago. If I had the fucking nerve.

1jcsm2v,suicidewatch,2025-03-16 18:50:29,my boyfriend shot himself,"I’ve never actually used Reddit before other than to try and sell my nudes or watch gore videos. He loved it though, I never knew what he was really looking at on here before. He was a drug addict, at 21. I knew he had an addictive personality when we met, we spoke so deeply about everything. I’m 21 too now but met in 8th grade, I still remember how having a crush on him felt. We had always been friends but I don’t think either of us really could work up the courage to try and start dating, that was until senior year of high school. We were both finally single for the first time in years and it felt like an opportunity I couldn’t pass up. I was always so much more in love with him than he was with me, or maybe it was just easier for me to express my love for him. I’ll never know now. I feel very numb, we didn’t have the healthiest relationship to be very honest. I forgot and forgave a lot of things most girls my age wouldn’t even be able to stomach, and I wasn’t always the best girlfriend. But we grew up together, learned together, lived on our own at 18 in a different state, together and we always told each other we felt like we just knew each other. He understood me in ways even I couldn’t understand. It was one of those relationships that when was good, it was so, so good. And when it was bad, things got scary you couldn’t possibly predict where’d you’d end up. All of our arguments ended in one of these three scenarios, crazy good sex, a breakup, or a physical fight where we’d both hurt one another until we were satisfied. Never resolution. I always tried to push for that, to talk about things and change our behavior, make things better for both of us in the relationship. Nothing I ever said really got through to him, his good side is the only good I’ve ever really known in terms of love. I didn’t have a great childhood, most of friendships didn’t hold up and my mother was abusive. I never had anyone to go to, my siblings never really got the worst of it like I did. He was the first guy I had talked to you that wanted to know the bad parts, he was curious, and validated my emotions. He was so kind to me there in beginning, he would speak to me so softly. I still to this day have never met a man more in touch with his emotions at 17, I think that was part of the issue though. Both of us have always been so aware, of ourselves, this life, the ups and downs, the beauty in the brutally terrible. He gave me the best moments of my life and the absolute worst, he was an enigma to me. I miss him and I feel relief at the same time. I’ve been so scared to say that, it feels so dirty. But I don’t think I’ve been awake mentally for at least a year.

He found me while i was tying the Rope, he said ""get on the car now, we Need to talk"", i got on the car and he said ""wheres the Rope, give It to me, you got horrible ideas in your mind"".

I tried to deny everything but in the end i had to admit It.

They were destroyed. My mom was crying and trembling, my dad couldn't believe It and he felt guilty for It. I hugged my mom then started crying.

We talked for a bit and my dad was angry and said that It was a selfish and weak decision that would have destroyed them even more, i said Sorry and hugged him. He hugged me back, i asked him ""what can i do to make y'all feel Better?"" He responded ""we Just want YOU to feel Better, please Just try again (with the therapy), i love you and i cannot live without you"".

Now they don't trust leaving me alone or leaving the house, and they took everything that i could hang myself with.

These days they are more kind and i'm grateful for all of this, but at the same time i feel shame and suffering and i want to do It again.

I burden everyone around me, I make them all miserable. I'm disabled and have so many health problems that I can't do anything about because I can't afford anything. I've been with the love of my existence for nearly five years. They're so beautiful, an amazing person inside and out. They're everything to me. The most precious thing in existence. Yet all I do is make them miserable. I make them depressed. I make them anxious. They only ever feel sorrow because of me. They want to be free of me, I know. I spend every waking moment, even every sleeping moment, wishing this weren't the truth. I just want them to love me and want me. I just want to spend my life with them. I wish I weren't so worthless. Even now writing this I'm anxious that they'll somehow see this and will leave me if they do :(

I keep hoping that I'm wrong, and that it'll turn out that I actually am worth the air I breathe. I keep waiting for that day to come.

1jky0mk,suicidewatch,2025-03-27 06:56:08,I just survived suicide. Here's my story,"Intending this to be a support post and place for people struggling with suicidal ideation to see someone's experience with it, and hopefully think about it with a new perspective. I'm 18 years old and I am a transgender woman. This is not the sole reason I felt depressed enough to take my own life, but it did contribute to it. A lot of it is self loathing - I saw myself as a horrible person, someone who ruins friendships around me, someone unlovable, someone who makes people uncomfortable without the self perspective to see that and stop it. As a family we've also been going through a terrible economic time. Our power was cut off by our energy company because we've been unable to make payments, and we're in the middle of a lengthy lawsuit with our employer. This led to me moving into a vacant flat owned by a friend. Alone. Two days after moving in, I swallowed 16 Panadol 250mg pills. The next part is a somewhat detailed description of my symptoms, so you might want to skip it. If you are considering suicide via overdose, I recommend you read, because this will happen to you if you try. Firstly, the fear set in. The realisation that I actually was going to die. Until you begin an attempt, you never actually get that feeling, and it's overwhelming. I found myself crouched on the bathroom floor, rubbing my thighs in stress, shaking uncontrollably from the caffiene in the pills, looking at the floor because the lights were too bright. I called a friend and told him I'd fucked up, and I took pills. He was going to come over that day anyway, so now he was just driving faster. 15 minutes after I took them, he arrived. At this point, I didn't have the worst symptoms, but the fear had already set in. We decided to attempt to make myself throw up. It took ages, sticking my hand down my throat, keeping my hair out of the way, and I finally vomited. It was a sickly brown and white substance, from the whiskey I'd gotten shitfaced on the night before and the Panadol respectively. But the symptoms didn't go away, it only got worse. We then decided to leave, and go to my friend's house which had more stuff and was closer to hospitals if needed. I felt incredibly queasy in the car. I threw up in a bag twice. It was yellow this time, and smelled vile. I got hot and sweaty each time I threw, and then cooled down immensly to the point of freezing and shivering. We got into the house and at this point I was pale, extremely pale. I was dizzy, my stomach hurt, my throat was on fire, my head was aching, and if I so much as moved even the slightest bit, I would nearly collapse and throw up again. The next bit lasted for 6 hours. It consisted of laying in the lap of my friend, picking up a bucket every half hour or so, painfully taking minutes to force myself to throw up, becoming incredibly hot and dizzy, then back to freezing and laying down for even sitting up was too much. I had to go to the toilet but I couldn't, I'd collapse if I got up. We got charcoal pills from a pharmacy to flush out the toxins. I had to swallow about a dozen massive, disgusting black pills which turned my vomit and saliva pitch black. I drank a solution where we mixed charcoal powder with water. It's not soluble, so I had uncomfortable fine grains of it in my mouth and teeth for hours. My teeth were black. I then had to swallow these enormous pills, about an inch across, to save my liver, or it'd fail and I'd die later if not that day. In total I threw up about 9 times to get it out of my system. Even after I finished, my stomach was still in immense pain, but I couldn't throw up any more, there was no relief. I had to sit uneasy for more hours, unable to eat, sit up, look around, go to the toilet, nothing. It was the most painful, miserable experience of my life. And I lived. I didn't die, I actually think it would have been quite difficult for me to die. Panadol, and most other pills have emetics that force you to throw up. Plus, people are closer than you think. Always. It's likely you will be saved, and then for the next hours you will suffer. So when I say it's not worth it, trust me. This happened yesterday, I'm laying in the spare bed of my friend's house having breakfast typing this, and we still need to wait and see if complications arise. Hopefully I don't have to go to a hospital because suicide is illegal and punishable in my country (as is being trans!), and I also have no health insurance, and no money to pay for treatment, both due to the economic and legal situation. How do I feel now? Happy to be alive. It made me realise I am loved, and that life is worth living, and death is far far too much effort for any benefit you get. I'll be out of this situation very soon, and hopefully be on the road to recovery. If you are to take away anything from this, it would be to reconsider. It is so, so incredibly painful to attempt suicide. Your body is literally shutting down and you are there to experience every second of it. And after you brush with death, you will realise what you will miss. You will realise who you will never see again, and how they truly feel about you, and how they will feel when you are gone.

but everyone was so immersed in their own worlds. everyone was laughing with their friends. watching a show. doing work on their laptop. calling family. it was like my life felt even more small and insignificant. it really did feel like i didn’t matter at all. 

i didn’t end up at the bridge like i intended. i wished to go home and reflect. the situation felt ironic but mainly just hurtful. it’s confirmed all thoughts i’ve had that my life is nothing valuable at all.

1jcd853,suicidewatch,2025-03-16 04:03:15,I have been stealing money from and lying to my parents about med school for years and I'm going to end my life for it,"Basically the title. I have been telling my parents that I was studying in medical school for the last 4 years and my parents generously paid my rent and tuition for the first two years of school. After the first two years, I then went on a leave of absence due to severe depression, but I didn't tell my parents about it. We're Asian, so I knew they wouldn't approve since they really don't believe in mental health stuff, and I really told myself I would use the time to get my mind right, study a bit and work on and improve myself. 

Well, the furthest thing from that ended up happening these last two years. I just ended up working part time just to cover rent and some basic living expenses, but I did nothing to cure my depression, didn't study at all, and got nothing done in life. I have basically been working for a few hours a day and wasting away in bed, and have nothing to show for the last two years. However, that didn't stop me from accepting my parents' money. While I did cover rent and food, my mom still made me microwaveable meals from time to time, bought me clothes and shoes and sent me some money every now and then. They thought all of this was an investment into my future, but really I was just squandering it away and being a lazy bum. I know I'm a horrible person for taking their love and support and money and doing nothing with it. I know I had so much privilege and threw it all away. I'm a fuckup who deserves absolutely no sympathy. But even knowing all this, I'm still a coward and I still haven't told them about any of this. Instead I've been weaving and telling them thousands of lies about what kinds of patients I've seen, the friends I've been talking to, the things I've learned, etc. As more time passed, I got deeper in the lie, so I kept telling more since I just didn't want to deal with the shitstorm that comes with the truth. I avoided my issues, telling myself that I would fix things eventually. 

Well, my ""graduation"" is coming up soon - my parents are so happy because they think I'm finally going to be a doctor soon. I can't lie my way out of this one. There's nowhere to go or run, so the truth is coming out. I can't bear to look them in the eye and reveal to them how badly I fucked up my life. I can't imagine how they'll feel when they realize the precious son they've been so proud of has been a pathological liar the past few years. They'll never see me the same again. Plus, my school is expecting me back in a few days, but I'm absolutely not ready at all, and I'm not allowed to ask for more time off. Not that it would be a good idea - clearly I've bungled the last two years, what good would another do? I'm looking at a lifetime with no career prospects, no good direction in life and no sense of purpose. So I'm finally going to do the right thing and rid the world of the disgusting piece of trash that I am. I plan on overdosing on some pills I have and hopefully dying in my sleep. Perhaps it will just be recorded as a sudden death, and I can preserve some dignity for myself. Either way, this nightmare of mine will be over. I'm sick and tired of lying to my parents' face. They didn't deserve this, and I don't deserve to live or have anything good in life. I'm really scared to die but I don't have a choice.

1ji2uid,alcoholism,2025-03-23 16:13:43,What alcohol withdrawals are actually like. (Graphic),"Well, I did it guys. I detoxed. I made it through. I posted on here four days ago (same title) but it was deleted because of ""intoxicated.""  I had intended to document the symptoms as I experienced them to hopefully educate and inform any heavily dependent alcoholics who want SO badly to break through but are afraid of the detox.  Shortly after posting a flood of comments and support came in but alas, the post is gone. I am fully sober right now moderators so you can calm down, it is all going to be ok.

For context, I chose to do my detox at home and without the help of any kind of medication. This is highly inadvisable. If you are ready to detox please seek professional medical help. It could save your life. All of the following symptoms could have been negated under the careful eye of a trained physician.

For qualification, I am an alcoholic and I have been struggling for 15 years. I was hospitalized 8 times last year because of my drinking. I am the real deal. It is the thing I am most ashamed of.

I recorded a lot of voice notes to later transcribe. FLD will mean ""from last drink.""

8 hours FLD: No super aggressive symptoms right now except for cravings, mild sweating and fear. I drank very heavily on my last day and I would guess after 8 hours I probably still had a blood alcohol content of about .08.

12 hours FLD: Nauseua so intense that I need to lay perfectly still on my back. If I move at all I am afraid I will throw up. Still no sleep, but strange almost time-lapse hours will go by where I think I slept but check the time and only 10 minutes would go by. It's like lucid dreaming but fully awake and only horrible dreams.  Sweating heavily at this point but too afraid to move the blankets off.

12:30 hours FLD: I made a mistake, I tried to drink water. This tiny movement instantly coated my entire body in a film of sweat and I began to dry-heave. It was like my body was rejecting the water it needed so badly. I heaved for about ten minutes. The only thing that came up was a yellow foam that tasted chemical. I did feel temporarily better after this dry heave session.

16 hours FLD: I believe I slept a little if you can call it that. The tremors are here now. These are terrible in public but not so bad alone except for the fear they bring on. The best way to describe what tremors feel like (for me) is it feels like a tiny car battery is attached to all of your nerves and it sends little pulses throughout your body. I've had a withdrawal seizure in the past and each pulse had me thinking it was going to happen again. My hands are visibly shaking, sitting on them helps. Some people just call it ""the shakes"" but it is more than that. It's like a thousand different, tiny spasms. Electricity running up my forearms and in my joints as well as terrible foot cramps.

20 hours FLD: Another dry-heaving session. Same weird, yellowish foam. It tastes like cigarettes and I don't smoke. This time I did not feel better after, but did get some water down once it was finished. My sheets are soaked in sweat. There is a restlessness and anxiousness that is too hard to describe. Crawling out of my skin is the closest I can come up with.

24 hours FLD: 24 hours! My God, it has been months since I have had 24 hours. I am visibly shaking very hard at this point but wrapped myself in a blanket and managed to go downstairs to use the bathroom. Looking in the mirror I am disgusted. My eyes are blood-shot, my lower lip is quivering and I can smell myself. I smell like gasoline, not body-oder but literally, I smell like ethanol. My urine is neon orange. No appetite, not even close. And no BM in 36 hours.

36 hours FLD: These last 12 hours are without a doubt the absolute most difficult part for me. The physical symptoms, while horrific, ABSOLUTELY pale in comparison to the mental horror of the 24-36 hour mark. 12 hours of the most terrible, deranged and vivid lucid dreaming I've ever experienced. My brain wanted to punish me it felt like. Almost complete paralysis, and awake-but-dreaming the most terrible and confusing things. Abstract things. None of which are real or ever happened. I dreamt my niece stepped on a shot glass I left on the floor and cut her foot open. I dreamt I had a seizure while driving and slammed into a minivan. I dreamt my family was in a burning house screaming for my help and I was trudging through a snow-covered lawn and I couldn't get to them because I was so drunk. There were hundreds of empty liquor bottles poking out of the snow. I just couldn't get to the burning house. And many, many, more terrible paralyzing dreams and images went through my head. Some that would make you sick if I typed them. I cannot stress enough how surreal the sleep-paralysis, lucid-dream thing is. This stage here (for me) was truly the worst!

48 hours FLD: I think the worst of it is over. My hands are still shaking really, really bad, but I don't have all the terrible pulse waves. Still no appetite, still no BM. I am now able to keep water down. I want to shower but am still afraid to stand up for that long. I licked my sweat and it tasted like cheap vodka. However, I did (and this was a crucial and important milestone) begin to finally, FINALLY, feel hope.

72 hours FLD: The third day (for me) was comparable to being regular sick. Like not-related-to-alcohol sick. Comparable to a bad case of the flu. (By the way, I have had the flu, I have had strep throat. When I was a teen I once had poison ivy on 70 percent of my body. All of that was nothing. An absolute walk in the park compared to what I went through here.) I was able to sit up and watch Netflix. Drink a lot of water and some broth. Tremors down to a minimum. Wouldn't be able to write with a pen very well but in comparison not bad.

82 hours FLD: And that leads to today. I am sober. I took my doctor-prescribed Antebuse. My appetite is the last thing that still hasn't really come back to normal but that is ok. I am going to an AA meeting later today with my brother.

Once again, I strongly recommend never trying this at home. The reason I am posting this is not to encourage it, it is in fact to hopefully persuade you to not detox without medical supervision. My detox is not your detox. Your detox WILL BE different than mine. Some people take over a week to detox. This is no joke.  Please seek professional medical help if you intend to detox. If this post convinces even one person to go to the hospital for their detox it is a massive victory.

I appreciate all the responses and the thoughtful comments I received from my original post. Thank you.

1jaw7h7,alcoholism,2025-03-14 04:54:24,My husband joined virtual AA meetings and it backfired.,"My husband (35/m) always argues that he’s not an alcoholic, because his vision of what an alcoholic is is the most severe case person who drinks around the clock, has DUIs but keeps drinking, misses work, etc. He will often congratulate himself on a Thursday for not having a drink since Monday, when the only reason he didn’t drink was because he works nights on Tuesdays and Wednesdays. 

We recently had an incident. To keep it short, my husband picked some really bad timing to do his worst. My dad had just had open heart surgery and it was the day/night before his discharge. My husband, while home alone with my mom, got day drunk on tequila, drove drunk to a bar where he stayed until after midnight, drove home even drunker, stumbled all over the house, pissed in our bed, slept through his alarm and was over an hour late to work, screamed at me at 6:30am as he was late and couldn’t find the car key so he accused me of hiding it from him, waking up me and my mom in the process even though we needed to sleep so we could bring my dad home and have the energy to take care of him. 

This particular incident fucked everything up. We didn’t speak for a week. I told him to get out, but he refused, so he secluded himself to the basement. My parents (who were staying with us for a few weeks post surgery so they could be close to the hospital) felt insanely awkward and burdensome, when they should have just been focused on my dad’s recovery. Completely shattered my parents’ opinion of him, and they were particularly upset he drove drunk. For me it felt like the final straw after years and years of incidents like this. It was hard to forgive his timing after I’d been crying and stressed for months about my dad’s surgery, and still couldn’t calm myself down even after the surgery was complete. I couldn’t fathom that he would do this with everything going on, that I couldn’t rely on my husband for strength during one of the most emotionally taxing experiences of my life. Bringing my dad home was supposed to be the first time I could finally catch my breath in months. Instead now I had to contend with possibly ending my marriage. 

I essentially reached the point of ultimatum - alcohol or me. I said that we’ve tried and failed enough times to “control” his drinking, and it’s now time to admit that drinking in moderation is simply not something he can do in any meaningful, long term way. He was scared of losing me, disappointed in himself, and agreed to start going to AA meetings and also try a “dry March” and see where that took him. (I should point out that it was early February when this happened - Super Bowl and his birthday were still coming up)

He joined a few AA meetings, virtually only, which felt a bit like a half assed effort but whatever. He told me he liked them and appreciated hearing people’s stories. But then it started to backfire. It seemed like his takeaway was that he wasn’t as bad as these people. He said people were congratulating him for coming to meetings as “early” as he was. He made it sound like everyone was reassuring him he wasn’t an alcoholic, which is I’M SURE not what actually happened. He told me the worst stories he’d heard from other people. And he *didn’t see himself in them*.

He didn’t give up alcohol in February but cut back and joined maybe 1 or 2 more virtual meetings (which is part of the repeat cycle of incident > cut back > creep-up > incident). He said “dry March” was going to be when the real work started. 

Cut to “dry March.” He snuck a beer 3 days into the month, gaslit me when I caught him, continues to insist that wasn’t a big deal and he’ll just add 3 days to the end to make up for it. Hasn’t joined a single meeting. Keeps insinuating that he will go back to drinking and just “get it under control” when March is over, which has a 0% success rate. 

We’re trying couples therapy starting on Tuesday, but even that he seems to think isn’t necessary and “we can just talk ourselves” (also isn’t working). 

I’m really exhausted that it for a moment felt like he was willing to work on this with me, but then his brain slowly reverted back to the old patterns of convincing himself that this isn’t a real problem. In fact, during an argument maybe a week ago, he said that if we ever get divorced he hopes I end up with a REAL alcoholic so I can see that he isn’t one. I immediately pointed out that I have NEVER dated anyone who drinks the way he does, and that he is the worst drinker of anyone I’ve ever been with. His rebuttal was “actually, I’m the BEST drinker.” 

I don’t know why I stay. I guess because the solution to all of our problems seems so simple and within reach - JUST STOP DRINKING. But it doesn’t seem like he wants to or thinks he needs to, and will argue until he’s blue in the face that he’s not an alcoholic because he’s not as bad as somebody else, who is a REAL alcoholic. 

I’m beginning to come to terms with possibly needing to end my marriage. I think he doesn’t realize how thin the ice is, and he assumes he can talk his way out of it. I don’t know how this is my life or how we got here. I’m so heartbroken and tired.

1jdfq90,alcoholism,2025-03-17 15:43:18,I've been a drinker most of my life. (I have 559 days sober today.) It seems easier just to go back to drinking.,"I got sober because alcohol makes me sick as a dog. Also because I saw my brother die of this disease in '23. Do I really have to find a deeper bottom?

I take 100mgs of Naltrexone daily to help quell cravings. Quite suddenly though, thoughts of drinking have returned. This insidious disease has me thinking that life was easier when I was drinking and I should just go back to it.

That's a laugh. A crock of BS. When I drank, it was 24/7. I seldom did anything else. That's what I consider ""easier."" 

Now that I'm sober, I'm having a lot of trouble doing much of anything. When I do have to do something, it seems unbelievably complicated and I just go back to bed. Going to bed (checking out of life) is my substitute addiction, along with copious amounts of sugar.

I feel like I'm not really sober at all, so why not start drinking again?

I know a lot of positive coping skills and grounding techniques, and I have many supportive people I can talk to. I won't drink through this time of questioning.

I want to, though.",151,41,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholism/comments/1jdfq90/ive_been_a_drinker_most_of_my_life_i_have_559/,Ive drinker life 559 days sober today seems easier go back drinking got sober alcohol makes sick dog Also saw brother die disease 23 really find deeper bottom take 100mgs Naltrexone daily help quell cravings Quite suddenly though thoughts drinking returned insidious disease thinking life easier drinking go back Thats laugh crock BS drank 247 seldom anything else Thats consider easier Im sober Im lot trouble much anything something seems unbelievably complicated go back bed Going bed checking life substitute addiction along copious amounts sugar feel like Im really sober start drinking know lot positive coping skills grounding techniques many supportive people talk wont drink time questioning want though
1j2ivcg,alcoholism,2025-03-03 13:39:47,I think I finally did it,"In two days, I’ll hit one month of sobriety. That might not seem like a long time to some, but for me, I’m absolutely certain I’ll never drink again.

On average, I was drinking about 500ml of hard liquor per day, sometimes 375ml, 750ml, or even 1,025ml. I had tried quitting many times but never made it past a few days.

The tipping point for me was a combination of two things:

1. I lost a childhood friend to alcoholism (liver failure) Much like me, he was suffering in silence and distanced himself from most people.


2. When that happened, I played the classic ""just one more day, I promise"" mind game with myself for 10 more days.



Then, I started feeling pins and needles all over, along with itching. It scared the hell out of me. It was very uncomfortable to even walk for a few minutes. That's when I cut back aggressively over the course of a week until I stopped. As withdrawal symptoms worsened, I felt burning sensations in my arms on top of everything else.

Thankfully, I'm now about 95% recovered from those symptoms, and I know I’ll continue improving. It’s been a gradual but steady process.

My biggest advice for anyone trying to quit:
Don't fall for the ""next week I'll quit"" trap. That’s just your addiction talking. I had to step back and look at myself from a third-person perspective to realize how ridiculous it was to keep feeding into those excuses.

If you're struggling, take the leap now, not tomorrow, not next week, but now. You’ve got this!

1jix7ee,alcoholism,2025-03-24 18:00:43,General thoughts on my 20+years of heavy drinking,"I’ve (45M) been drinking on average a pint of distilled alcohol (vodka or whiskey) 4-5 days a week for almost 10 years. I was a heavy binge drinker for 10 years before that, but I at least took time off here and there when binging…I’ve always drank a lot of water for what that’s worth? You should be doing that regardless!!!

Shockingly, I have thus far only experienced relatively minor digestive inflammation issues and some slightly elevated liver enzyme levels that dropped significantly when I took a month off and changed my diet. In other words, for whatever reason MY genes have thus far SEEMINGLY protected me from major physical damage. 

But, my marriage failed (she drank a lot too) As did the next relationship I was in (She drank a lot too. Seeing a pattern?) I haven’t pursued interests or career with the vigor I should have. I’ve let my house go to shit, neglected things that needed attention because I thought I’d have a drink or two and THEN take on that project…NAH! Just drink more.

That being said, the slow and steady weight gain, the acid reflux that I’m beginning to experience, my bloated face…all that aside…I’m tired. I sleep like shit most of the time. I’m tired of being subservient to a substance. I’m tired of wasting my money on something that makes me feel good for an hour and then I have to keep doing it to not feel like shit. 

Not to mention, all of this could just catch up to me at some point! Just because I’m relatively ok now doesn’t mean a few years from now I will be ok. And the long term mental effects are not something you can quantify until it’s too late. Also, not something people talk about a lot. It’s always just liver, kidney, stomach…

My mother was a mental health social worker for 45 years and the number of patients (some as young as early 30’s) who had alcohol-induced dementia was shocking to her. She always warned me and I didn’t listen…because I was born an addict. Not because of anything my parents did. It was in that same dna I just mentioned a few paragraphs ago. And in the sexual and physical trauma I experienced as a child. I was destined for this battle against trauma and alcohol was my mate.

I’m not saying alcohol should be outlawed. We tried that. Didn’t work very well. But, the casual approach we take to alcohol as a society is killing so many people. Cigarettes are gross. We all get that now (I still like having a heater or two..:addict! Did you read above?!) But, in my mind alcohol is the most insidious, deceitful and destructive substance on the planet outside of maybe opiates in general.

My hope here is that any younger folks reading this will think twice before they get habituated to boozing every weekend at college or whatever…or thinking it’s ok cos it’s legal. First of all. That’s self-medication talk. Seek out therapy NOW! Don’t wait until you’re 45! Trust us ‘old’ folks!!!!

I will end this with a story of sorts. When I was 19 I worked in a restaurant. There was a guy who would buy be a six-pack of Killian’s Irish Red beer.::I drank a six pack a night for months on end…loved how it made me feel. But, I stopped myself at 19 and acknowledged that I might have a problem. I didn’t drink alcohol for nearly 2 years…until my 21st birthday. It’s been downhill ever since.

IF you’re ’new to this’ and feel like you might have a problem controlling your drinking, stop NOW. Don’t let yourself get to where we are. I beg you. Trust me. Believe me.

1ja2iy1,alcoholism,2025-03-13 03:05:53,terrified,"UPDATE: Idk if anyone sees this but its now two days after i wrote that post. I’m at the hospital because I believe i had a seizure.

i had a realisation that i need to sort myself out. after years of 7+ standards drinks a day, over double twice a week on weekends, it’s finally caught up to me.

i didn’t piece together all of the odd things my body does until tuesday after a massive binge drink. Its been weeks since i’ve had a normal bowel movement, i’ve had neon yellow with extreme urgency, i shake all day and sweat, i get drunker faster, and most recently my right abdomen aches and twangs with pain constantly. 

the past few days i’ve been seeing things out of the corner of my eye and get the most insane jumpscare only for it to be my own shadow or a pile of clothes.

a few hours after waking up and before i start drinking i already feel ‘drunk’. my personality has changed for the better but i think its an effect of this. i’m extremely depressed but these past few weeks im on top of the world. my nose wont stop running and my throat aches incredibly.

im trying to taper my drinks down, and last night i was crying in bed from the pain on my side. My cat jumped on the bed and literally pawwed at my side, lay down and snuggled up where it ached. that was my sign that i’ve gone too far because shes a cat!! how does she know?

im on nightshift and when i wake up everything is closed so i can’t go anywhere to get help. cant miss a day of work because bills are insane and because i’m stupid i haven’t managed to save money - it all goes on booze.

i dont want advice, i just want to vent

i took it way too far 

Edit/update : I called a health helpline and they forwarded my concerns to my docter. I had my phone off while I was sleeping but bizarrely woke up to my doctor calling demanding I come in.
 I went on an hour of sleep, got bloods done and am awaiting the results. started crying because the doctor is so expensive and i was thinking about all the drink i could have bought with that money which is so pathetic. forced into a more extreme taper now until payday bc i can’t afford more bottles.

1jcldu4,alcoholism,2025-03-16 13:25:11,Sister just dropped a bombshell,"I had lunch with my sister yesterday. I know she’s been drinking a lot lately because her body has changed and she’s lost a lot of weight in the last year. She’s been a daily drinker since the 90s. She 47 now. She confessed that she’s drinking a 750ml bottle of vodka a day. 

I’ve been sober for 15 years and struggled with drug and alcohol addiction. Getting sober was hard, but I did it. I’ve even helped a few friends get sober over the years. But they called me asking for help. They were ready. My sister was adamant yesterday that she doesn’t want to pursue sobriety. I told her I would put my whole life on hold to help her, bring her to meetings, etc. She doesn’t want that. She acknowledged that she has a problem but sobriety isn’t what she wants. 

I’ve never been in a position to try and get someone to want to get sober. I’ve only ever helped people who have told me they want to get sober. I am sick over the conversation I had with her yesterday. She’s wasting away. Her body is shutting down. Her teeth are rotting. I terrified she’s going to die. She weighs maybe a hundred pounds. 

I’m not sure what I want to achieve from posting this. Maybe just writing this all down will help me realize things real and not something to run away from or ignore. Has anyone here ever dealt with someone they love actively killing themselves and not wanting to get sober?

1j1hopy,alcoholism,2025-03-02 03:35:04,"After 3 years straight of heavy daily drinking, I'm at 10 days sober","To preface I'm 22 years old. I've been drinking a very large amount for my age. I'd really appreciate some insight on how to prevent any relapses in the future.

I'm very surprised I've managed to make it this far. I've been drinking daily for 2 years and escalated my usage from 8 30ml shots of vodka a day to 16-22 shots. Alcohol completely lost all of it's positive effects and started giving me psychosis and heavy anxiety during some of my hangovers. I'd hear voices and see movement in the corners of my vision and see scary imagery when closing my eyes. I'd get a feeling of anger and depression each time I drank instead of the euphoric feelings I used to get and I would continue to drink out of the association that it was the cure to bad feelings when in reality it was causing all of them. Alcohol used to send me sleep after just a few shots and now no matter how much I drink it will never knock me out or produce positive effects.

I'm far too young to be drinking this much, nobody my age drinks even 10% of the amount I do and it's clear I'll die very quickly if I continued like that.

I tried quitting when my drinking was at its heaviest and had some withdrawal symptoms, I had a strong anxiety and feeling in my body of restlessness along with a high blood pressure. After quitting for a few days I'd just go right back to where I was and repeat the cycle. This was very dangerous in retrospect but I'm OK now.

I have been slowly reducing my usage over the past 2 months to 8 shots a day again and I finally had enough and decided to quit.

The longest I've quit before this was for 3 days, and I had done that about half a dozen times. I feel my desire to drink is completely gone now and my mind feels infinitely more stable even after such a short period of time. Each day is different but I'm noticing a trend of the life coming back to me slowly.

I'm just posting to celebrate this small win. I don't consider myself to have quit until I've been sober for longer.

When we first met, I (F32) picked up on it pretty quickly; I found he was drinking 1/2 liter of vodka a day. I’m a nurse and not a lot gets by me unfortunately. That being said, in the past I would have immediately left upon discovering an addiction issue, and I found this out pretty early on, however for some reason, I felt like this situation was “different”. And maybe part of me still thinks that. I thought about how militant and determined my husband is, and how he has an amazing family who would be supportive beyond supportive, and me. I felt like I was looking at a broken person and I felt like he deserved someone to help him through this awfulness. Over the course of 2 years I began slowly and gently trying to introduce the idea of his drinking being potentially abnormal. He wasn’t receptive of my early attempts however, he ended up having a W/D seizure right after we got engaged. He had taken on a temporary second job and genuinely didn’t have time to drink, so after a few days I woke up to him seizing on our kitchen floor. They did bloodwork in the ER and his liver values were triple the normal range. After this happened, he got more serious about addressing the issue. From there he cut his drinking down significantly. There would be periods where he wouldn’t drink every day, and on the days he did drink it was much less than before. It wasn’t perfect but a lot of progress was made. He ended up getting his bloodwork rechecked and his liver function returned to normal bc of all the work he had been doing. Problem being, I think he took this as a license to drink again. At this point, I wasn’t pushing hard for anything in particular, just maintained my patience and having small talks when the opportunity arose, offering resources if he was interested. Well, at some point, I went to his job for an event that he was working as an employee for, and he was drinking. I watched him talking to his boss and other leaderships/coworkers all while he’d been drinking and continuing to drink out of a shaker bottle. His parents were there as well. So that was obviously a “thing”. We had a serious talk about the severity of the situation. His parents also called them bc they also noticed. That inspired a bit of change but it wasn’t until he came home drunk from work and I wrote him a letter telling him how scary his drinking had become to me. After this letter he was sober for 23 days but relapsed and has been hit or miss since. My real issue right now, is his behavior has severely deteriorated over the last 6 months - year. He starts fights constantly when we never used to fight at all. I can just be sitting there and he’ll just start in on me about money usually. We both work, but I’m the primary breadwinner. We used to have our money together, but he was constantly berating me about what I was spending money on, making me account for every charge, wanting to see my phone to see if I had money I was hiding from him, etc, so we separated it. He owns the house we live in and he’s always used that against me, like you’re welcome for letting you live here kind of thing, and he insists I’m not grateful for the things he does for me. I tell him thank you all the time for the things he does for me. The thing is, 90% of the time, things are great. We’ve always gotten along amazingly well. Never fought, always on the same page. He finally started opening up to me when he relapsed about his mental health issues (he struggles with being open about how he’s feeling or doing), he told me the only time he felt at peace and relaxed is when we’re just hanging out together doing our thing. and I thought we were in a really good place. He started coming home drunk again and at the end of the week, he was about to go to another event at his job and I was pretty sure he had been drinking so I asked him if he had been drinking to please stay home bc I didn’t want anything bad to happen to him. Ever since then, it’s been open season on me. He’s blaming me, saying our relationship is stressful and that’s why he’s drinking. He says I make him anxious and he always thinks I’m mad at him. I’m literally never mad at this man, I come home excited to see him every day but I also don’t know which version of him I’ll get all the time. He’s telling me he’s unhappy, that nothing makes him happy anymore and it started when he married me. This has me questioning my entire reality when last month, I was his only happy place,  we have so much fun together and have always had the best relationship despite his addiction. His drinking has become a lot more problematic (trying to hide it and drinking and driving, drinking around work etc) than it used to be, but I don’t think I’m treating him any differently outside of being tougher on him about drinking and driving. All that being said, he made an appointment with a couples therapist who specializes in addiction as well, so he’s TRYING, but his behavior is so alarming to me that I’m not sure if I should even invest any more of myself here? Or is this like the turning point? Are these behaviors he’s exhibiting typical for an alcoholic? Im in the middle of getting ready for a trial this summer and fall from when  my cousin SAed me back in 2016, so I really don’t want to make any decisions about uprooting my life until that’s over, but he keeps coming at me guns blazing. I really don’t know what to do. Any and all advice would be appreciated.

1j8m1te,alcoholism,2025-03-11 08:27:59,My dad is dying / my first ever (intimate) online post,"I was walking my dog the other night and I had this overwhelming urge to share my story, but not with friends or family but with online strangers who might find some familiarity, maybe even solace in my words.

My dad is 59 years old and he's been in the hospital for nearly 4 months now. 
Everything started when he was abroad on holidays. A good samaritan decided it was time to get him into the emergency room because he was turning yellow, his limbs were all swollen and he had a hard time breathing.
He was rushed into the ICU where his condition worsened and he had to be intubated. Someone took his phone and messaged me and I flew across the globe to rush to see him.

The sight of him was horrifying. He obviously couldn't speak and the doctors hardly spoke English so the whole situation was a nightmare.
I had to leave after a week, not knowing if I ever saw him again. 
Slowly, his condition improved. He was taken off the ventilator and his liver and kidney recovered. After almost 6 weeks, he was finally able to be flown back home.

Fast forward to today and he's still in the hospital. 
His condition was constantly up and down. 
He lost so much weight. I simply cannot fathom how he got to this point. When I tell you my dad was a body builder back in the 80's and had never touched alcohol until his late twenties and now he's a fragile ""old"" man who can't even use the bathroom on his own.

The hardest part is the unknown, the uncertainty of it all. Doctors are so fucking vague and hardly ever available to talk. All we know is that he has cirrhosis.

Last week, we got a huge slap in the face when he was finally discharged from the hospital and went to a rehabilitation centre.
After only 4 days they sent him back to the hospital...

It might be important to note that I've actually had a really tumultuous relationship with my dad, mostly because of his addiction. 
I don't want to get into the details but this feels like another punishment, an impossible one because he is dying and all I can do is... nothing really. I can't even tell him I love him because our relationship had been so far gone, I couldn't even tell you the last time I hugged him. 
If he's actually going to die, it feels like dealing with a double loss in a sense and I'm lost. I'm angry, hurt, disappointed and sad.

And guess how I'm dealing with all of this? 
Yes. Mostly alcohol.

If you've read this far, thank you for listening. I don't expect anything in return, I just needed to tell this story.

1jkze58,alcoholism,2025-03-27 08:42:55,What's worked for me. Hope it helps you.,"https://preview.redd.it/85qi7vr537re1.jpg?width=828&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d25f53f217d70c6e516c5be10710eca5eaf947ff

I'm 1,000 days sober today. Heading to 3 years in July. Here's what has helped me:

• Cherry pick the advice you see here, in books, and elsewhere. Hit upon the right mix of tools that work for you. Like trying a few combinations on a safe door before it clunks open.

• Fast forward the tape. How will having a drink now affect me tomorrow morning? What's happened before? A slide back into what? It’s a good way to remind yourself to be kinder to yourself, and that you have the power to remove yourself from the torture.

• Don't 'white knuckle it' this time. Use other ways to deal with the pangs and they will become thoughts you can bat away, quicker and quicker each time. 

Find techniques like 'fast forward the tape' that work for you. I found 'urge surfing' really useful in my first two weeks. Delay, Distract, Decide is gold, too. Worth googling.

A change of environment works wonders. Go out for a drive or a walk or a coffee. Call a friend and get into talking about something else.

• Know that it only take 10 days or so for alcohol to leave your body. Then it's not alcohol you're addicted to - it's the thought of it. It's the misconceptions you have about it. There is some de-brainwashing to do.

• Be patient with yourself. I used to say, 'I want to get sober quick, like in a movie montage'! Hang on in there - while you've got to stay vigilant, it does get easier too.

Recognise that you want fast results. As drinkers, we're used to quick fixes. (I used to joke, ‘I downloaded the app, why do I still get pangs?!’) You'll look at the time gone by and wish you could leap forward to six months or a year and be done with it. Know that you will get there, even if you can't make the clock hands spin faster.

• Lots of people who drink go from using-to-feel-happy to using-to-feel-nothing. I believe that long-term recovery is all about finding peace in other ways. Could be as simple as starting or re-starting a hobby, trying guided meditation. Or even changing jobs or addresses. The old cliche is true: it’s a change of lifestyle not a life sentence.

• Books! A lot of people recommend This Naked Mind. However, I found a lot of brilliant practical advice in The 10 Day Alcohol Detox. Also, for  entertainment and empathy, The Unexpected Joy of Being Sober made me laugh and stay on track.

• Keep your webcam and microphone off if you want to at first, but attend an online meeting. Doesn't have to be AA. There are lots of different types out there. Try a few. This will let you connect with others who 'get it'. Such a relief. And a reassurance knowing you can experience something and go back and tell them, and get understanding.

'The opposite of addiction is connection' didn't make sense to me at first. It does now.

• Celebrate the wins. One day at a time - or even one hour at a time if you have to, at first. Count the days, the money saved (and use it to buy yourself treats), the calories if you like. Use an app on your phone. iamdonedrinking.com is good. iamsober.com also has communities of people at the same stage of recovery as you. One day... one week.. etc etc.

• Don't be afraid to protect yourself; your recovery. Walk away if you need to. Go into another room or leave the building if a situation is not right for you. Your circle of friends may change a little. You will know that, 'You lie with dogs, you get fleas'! 

For the first year or so, I didn’t go out much, while I was finding my way. Now I turn up to some parties if there are new/good people there, get interested in them, join in fun conversations, etc ...but when things get too lairy I go - my time's too precious to be bored by pissed people :-)

• Enjoy waking up without a hangover. Drive somewhere late at night. Explore doing stuff you couldn't before. As you heal, your attractions change too. Toxicity stops looking like excitement, peace stops looking like boredom.

• Your sleep gets better. You’ll gain more time in the day. These days I naturally wake and get up an hour before my alarm and read or do something else I want to before my workday begins - no hungover rush any more.

• Complexion gets better. My face was puffy - it isn’t now. It’s easier to concentrate and communicate. Work’s easier. Relationships so, so much better.

• Make a list of all the crap you had to put up with when you were a drinker. The hangovers, the zombie hours, blackouts? Sneakiness? All of it. Doesn’t apply any more. Keep a healthy memory of it (in other words, don't focus on regret but remember not to go back)

• Use the extra time you gain. 'If only there were more hours in the day' - now there are! Get into something that you enjoy and absorbs you. Could be something you abandoned a while back, something you've always wanted to get round to doing, or something completely new. A hobby, a pastime ...and don't feel guilty for spending time on yourself.

• Enjoy! Not having to drink any more feels so much better than any drink tastes. Enjoy your new life, remembering to glance over your shoulder occasionally so you don’t want to go back.

It's all about de-programming ourselves, I believe, and finding happier ways to live. 

It really does get easier, as your mindfulness and vigilance just become second nature, urges decrease, and you reap more and more benefits.

My autism and ocd are WORSE. My anxiety about things I was moving on from came back all over again. MRI shows how chronic drinking will damage regions, often quicker in some. I only was focused on my physical health, forgetting your mind is a thing that is often as bad to wreck.
You will get hallucinatory like dreams of your issues like no nightmare.

If you are in therapy and actively drinking, your brain is making absolutely no connections. It's basically as if you didn't attend at all. The mind consolidation effect takes place after therapy, that doesn't happen if you are drunk and can't even sleep.

1jcxzk3,alcoholism,2025-03-16 22:47:42,2 years sober! 🥳 Here's my story,"
As I'm (25F) two years sober tomorrow (HELL YEAH!!!) I wanted to be vulnerable and share some of my experiences. Do be aware before you start reading i am talking about my experiences with addiction and so this might be triggering. So if you're not in a good space then lovingly please skip this one ❤️‍🩹


Since trying alcohol as a teenager I had struggled with having way too much and often blacking out and putting myself in dangerous and embarrassing situations and causing myself to have the worst hangovers imaginable. I tried quitting so many times but would always end up drinking again

A couple times I was so drunk, and staying at a friends house, that I pissed myself in my sleep. The most embarrassing thing ever and yet I still couldn't give it up. Another time I was by myself in my uni halls and I woke up realising I had pissed on my floor in my room. This is really embarrassing to share but I think it's important to include 😅 

From around the ages of 20 my hangovers got seriously bad to the point where I would be throwing up constantly for the whole of the day after. I would often spend the day in bed puking into my bin and struggling to get anything down. A few times it landed me in the hospital because I needed IV fluids

One day I went out for lunch with some friends and started drinking at lunch then spent the rest of the day drinking and then being ill. I would find every excuse to drink

When I went on a holiday with my Dad I spent every other night getting completely plastered and then spending the following day in bed with my head in a bin

I went to a concert with my best friend and I ended up getting so many drinks i barely remember the second half of the concert. I spent the next day throwing up in a train toilet on my way back home

Visiting my parents was a big trigger for me drinking and I would often spend an evening drinking and, again, spending the next day being ill

The amount I would drink was often completely excessive and I would cause arguments with friends who were just trying to help cut me off at the end of the night. My life revolved around the next time I'd be drinking. I was in complete denial.

 One hosptial trip I had a chat with a mental health nurse and after opening up about my struggles she told me 'it's normal for students to drink'. The normalisation of drinking to excess, especially for young people, in my country (England) is so bad

The last time I drank I had gone to the pub with some friends and I only drank two pints which for me was a big achievement. However I still ended up constantly throwing up the next day so my friends took me to A&E. That was a massive wake up call for me and it was incredibly difficult but it somehow ended up being the last time I ever drank

The excessive drinking and puking caused me to develop gastritis and so I had to take a PPI for several months.

 My friends helped me so much and were there for me throughout the whole journey and I am forever grateful. I have drifted from some of them but I will never forget how them encouraged me and kept me going

I still struggle with cravings fairly often but drinking alcohol free drinks helps massively. And therapy. Therapy has been a real lifesaver for me. A massive reason i would drink was to avoid certain thoughts and feelings. Starting trauma therapy was one of the hardest things I've ever done but also arguably the best thing I've ever done and will continue to do

For the last few months of quitting drinking and after i was addicted to weed and that funnily enough did help me give up alcohol too because i basically switched from one substance to another. Until a few months later when I went fully sober after developing CHS (cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome) but that's a story for another day 

Since being diagnosed with POTS I realise that along with the sheer amount i would drink, the reason my hangovers were always so unbearable is because they would trigger a POTS flare up

I don't think past me would believe me if I told them that I am now 2 years sober and actually doing okay. I still struggle a lot but I always remind myself how much worse things could be if I was still in active addiction. So here's to me for getting through it 🥹🥳❤️‍🩹

I also want to share some experiences, some beautiful, some dreadful, but all would have been ruined or made far worse if i was still drinking. I need to remind myself why I gave up and how much better things are for doing so

My graduation
If i was still drinking i would have ended up drunk and forgetting half the day. But instead I celebrated with my best friend and my cousin with a wholesome meal and alcohol free prosecco.

Going through CHS while working an intense cleaning job and finding out my Dad was seriously ill. It's almost like my vomiting from alcohol latched onto cannabis and made me give that up too. I was very tempted to relapse with alcohol but I stuck it through

Being in crisis while my Dad was dying (he was 81) but living a few hours away. And when I would visit, getting triggered about being in my childhood home

Getting diagnosed with POTS and having so much of my life finally make sense and learning how to make things easier for myself. Alcohol is a trigger for POTS so there's even more reason to stick to sobriety now!

Going to a peach prc concert (she was one of my inspirations for giving up alcohol)

Thank you for reading if you got this far. I am so f'ing proud of myself and so happy with how far I've come. I'm genuinely so shocked I've made it this far but I did and here's to many more years of sobriety!!",22,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholism/comments/1jcxzk3/2_years_sober_heres_my_story/,2 years sober Heres story Im 25F two years sober tomorrow HELL YEAH wanted vulnerable share experiences aware start reading talking experiences addiction might triggering youre good space lovingly please skip one Since trying alcohol teenager struggled way much often blacking putting dangerous embarrassing situations causing worst hangovers imaginable tried quitting many times would always end drinking couple times drunk staying friends house pissed sleep embarrassing thing ever yet still couldnt give Another time uni halls woke realising pissed floor room really embarrassing share think important include around ages 20 hangovers got seriously bad point would throwing constantly whole day would often spend day bed puking bin struggling get anything times landed hospital needed IV fluids One day went lunch friends started drinking lunch spent rest day drinking ill would find every excuse drink went holiday Dad spent every night getting completely plastered spending following day bed head bin went concert best friend ended getting many drinks barely remember second half concert spent next day throwing train toilet way back home Visiting parents big trigger drinking would often spend evening drinking spending next day ill amount would drink often completely excessive would cause arguments friends trying help cut end night life revolved around next time Id drinking complete denial One hosptial trip chat mental health nurse opening struggles told normal students drink normalisation drinking excess especially young people country England bad last time drank gone pub friends drank two pints big achievement However still ended constantly throwing next day friends took AE massive wake call incredibly difficult somehow ended last time ever drank excessive drinking puking caused develop gastritis take PPI several months friends helped much throughout whole journey forever grateful drifted never forget encouraged kept going still struggle cravings fairly often drinking alcohol free drinks helps massively therapy Therapy real lifesaver massive reason would drink avoid certain thoughts feelings Starting trauma therapy one hardest things Ive ever done also arguably best thing Ive ever done continue last months quitting drinking addicted weed funnily enough help give alcohol basically switched one substance another months later went fully sober developing CHS cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome thats story another day Since diagnosed POTS realise along sheer amount would drink reason hangovers always unbearable would trigger POTS flare dont think past would believe told 2 years sober actually okay still struggle lot always remind much worse things could still active addiction heres getting also want share experiences beautiful dreadful would ruined made far worse still drinking need remind gave much better things graduation still drinking would ended drunk forgetting half day instead celebrated best friend cousin wholesome meal alcohol free prosecco Going CHS working intense cleaning job finding Dad seriously ill almost like vomiting alcohol latched onto cannabis made give tempted relapse alcohol stuck crisis Dad dying 81 living hours away would visit getting triggered childhood home Getting diagnosed POTS much life finally make sense learning make things easier Alcohol trigger POTS theres even reason stick sobriety Going peach prc concert one inspirations giving alcohol Thank reading got far fing proud happy far Ive come Im genuinely shocked Ive made far heres many years sobriety
1jfqfgw,alcoholism,2025-03-20 14:39:56,Dealing with the eventual loss of my brother,"My brother is an alcoholic. We always knew he drank, but saw the severity of it in early 2024. It was eye opening. I won’t post pictures but I hope I can talk about what we found. In his house, trash bags and I mean dozens of trash bags of empty beer containers. Boxes and boxes of empty gallon size vodka bottles. A house in total disarray. 

This all came to light when he had a seizure from withdrawal, in front of his daughter. He wasn’t trying to quit, the only reason he didn’t drink the night before was because his daughter was going over. He went to the hospital, they did some neurological tests, and found cognitive issues. They were going to check his liver the next day, but he left the hospital in the middle of the night and started drinking immediately. He eventually had to go back and did the same exact thing. This was after being arrested and was basically forced to be at the hospital for a few days. It got to a point where his girlfriend kicked him out and he had no place to go. She eventually moved out of state. No money, no job, he had nothing. 

Everyone in my family were really not willing to take him in, I felt like I had to step up. Me taking him in probably didn’t help anything, but what else was I going to do? I was sure if he stayed on the street, he would’ve died. I set the ground rules with him, and he adhered for the most part. I saw an effort being made, despite the couple of times I caught him drinking. Again, maybe I should’ve been more strict and stuck to zero tolerance, but I saw effort. 

After about 4 months of living with me, he reconciled with his girlfriend and moved in with her out of state. That’s been since about August. Those two together are so incredibly toxic, both have an addictive personality, we knew this wasn’t going to be good but we couldn’t stop him. 

Fast forward to this week, his girlfriend forced him to go to the hospital because his stomach was 3x the normal size. He has stage 4 cirrhosis and hepatitis, essentially a death sentence. He again left the hospital, started drinking, and living what he thinks is a normal life. He has no recollection of being at the hospital. 

People talk about rock bottom. He has no rock bottom. Rock bottom for most I think would’ve been having a seizure in front of your daughter. If not that, being told you have 1 year to live certainly is rock bottom. Not for him. He is so incredibly stubborn, in denial, and under no circumstances will accept any help at all. He seems content spending his last days with a bottle of vodka. 

So now we as a family have to deal with this, his addiction is going to be our pain for the rest of our lives. How do you deal with someone who won’t accept anything, who won’t openly admit he has a problem? Now unfortunately, him stopping may only get him a little more time. It’s past the point of him stopping and living a normal life. Is the effort futile? Will it just cause more pain down the road? But how can you abandon someone you love? How can someone remain so stubborn when faced with this horrific reality?",21,14,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholism/comments/1jfqfgw/dealing_with_the_eventual_loss_of_my_brother/,Dealing eventual loss brother brother alcoholic always knew drank saw severity early 2024 eye opening wont post pictures hope talk found house trash bags mean dozens trash bags empty beer containers Boxes boxes empty gallon size vodka bottles house total disarray came light seizure withdrawal front daughter wasnt trying quit reason didnt drink night daughter going went hospital neurological tests found cognitive issues going check liver next day left hospital middle night started drinking immediately eventually go back exact thing arrested basically forced hospital days got point girlfriend kicked place go eventually moved state money job nothing Everyone family really willing take felt like step taking probably didnt help anything else going sure stayed street wouldve died set ground rules adhered part saw effort made despite couple times caught drinking maybe shouldve strict stuck zero tolerance saw effort 4 months living reconciled girlfriend moved state Thats since August two together incredibly toxic addictive personality knew wasnt going good couldnt stop Fast forward week girlfriend forced go hospital stomach 3x normal size stage 4 cirrhosis hepatitis essentially death sentence left hospital started drinking living thinks normal life recollection hospital People talk rock bottom rock bottom Rock bottom think wouldve seizure front daughter told 1 year live certainly rock bottom incredibly stubborn denial circumstances accept help seems content spending last days bottle vodka family deal addiction going pain rest lives deal someone wont accept anything wont openly admit problem unfortunately stopping may get little time past point stopping living normal life effort futile cause pain road abandon someone love someone remain stubborn faced horrific reality
1jedwik,alcoholism,2025-03-18 19:43:09,"My boyfriend was forced to be sober but misses his ""old life""","Hi Everyone,

  
I (50F) met my boyfriend (52M) online and for the first part of our relationship were long distance and he was thinking of moving out to my state to be with me.  He suffered a massive stroke 2 years ago and instead I moved out to the west coast to be with him.  Since we were long distance I didn't realize he was a full blown alcoholic until I moved here, as when we visited and hung out together in person he never drank, and in his online profile he claimed to be ""no alcohol"" and I thought great, we are on the same page as I don't drink at all.  He was drunk a couple of times when we talked on the phone but made it sound like it was a ""one off"" thing due to a relative having died suddenly, not any kind of relapse.

Now that I have moved out here to help him in his stroke recovery, I have realized the extent of his issues with alcohol and the consequences it has had on his life.  His whole family has severe issues with alcohol, and they never encouraged him in his previous attempts at sobriety.  I believe my boyfriend and his siblings may have had some fetal alcohol exposure as well.  My boyfriend has had several previous DUIs in the past and was processed out of the military and then let go from a job he really loved due to alcohol issues.

My boyfriend had gone on a bender/drinking binge the night right before he had the stroke, and his massive ischemic stroke may have been caused by this.

Due to the severity of the stroke, my boyfriend now has severe left field hemianopia (left side visual field loss) and has had his driver's license permanently suspended and is not expected to be able to drive again.  He is considered ""low vision"" (almost legally blind but not quite), and he gets very turned around and confused and would get lost easily if he were on his own.  He has severe balance and fatigue issues, and after the stroke needs someone with him at all times for guidance and assistance.  He has made a miraculous recovery in other aspects regarding his stroke as he can still use both sides of his body, can speak, understand, walk, do most activities of daily living on his own, etc., but he did need occupational therapy, speech/memory therapy, and physical therapy for about a year after the stroke.  His memory has also been impacted, his short-term memory is still not good and even some of his long-term memories seem to have been wiped out.

He was forced into sobriety as he spent a month in the hospital after the stroke, then a month at a rehabilitation center, and then moved in with his daughter and her boyfriend who are alcohol free for 3 months while I got my stuff together and moved out here, and then he moved in with me and I am also alcohol free, so he simply has not had and does not have access to alcohol.  He definitely misses his old alcoholic life, going out and drinking, ""getting into trouble"" as he likes to say, buying everyone rounds, etc.  He seems like he struggled all his life to give up alcohol, but in the end a medical issue made him give it up, but I am sure if he had physical access to alcohol he would use and abuse it.  We live right by several liquor stores, but he couldn't make it there on his own even if he wanted to.

It seems like the stroke was a blessing in disguise sometimes, as it forced him to make a lifestyle changes he couldn't have or didn't want to make on his own.  The price he paid was very high, as the vision loss, constant dizziness and fatigue after the stroke, the loss of balance and having to use a cane or walker or wheelchair, are all things he now has to live with and that he hates.  He is now totally and permanently disabled and will not be going back to work.

  
He is a very smart, funny and sweet guy, and somehow after the stroke the best parts of his personality and who he is as a person seemed to have remained, but he is very discouraged by this new ""limited"" life that has been thrust upon him.

I guess I wanted to share this story is to encourage those reading to give up alcohol before the decision is forced on you by illness, disability, jail, etc.  You can do this!

1j6wbu2,alcoholism,2025-03-09 01:23:21,Alcohol is so disgusting to me now.,"I used to have a really bad drinking problem. Like if I went out, I'd have to get my own bottle for myself. It was so bad I was drinking almost every day or sometimes every day. 

This isn't really an issue but I finally beat the shit out of alcoholism. I didn't use therapy or anything, I just shocked myself into quitting essentially.

    Anyway it's been about over half a year since I drank heavily and I went out with friends the other day to the bar, had 2 beers, friend offered shots and my alcoholic brain said ""oh hell yeah"" and then for like 2 hours afterwards I couldn't drink anything or move suddenly without the immediate urge to throw up. Completely sober trying not to throw up from alcohol had me feeling pathetic and then I found myself thanking God or my body or whomever there is to thank for making it so easy to not pick up drinking again.

I find myself drinking a MAX of 2 beers like once every other month or so when I go out. More than that, I'll feel atrocious and just want to go to bed.

Idk why I'm making this post. Just don't really have anybody to talk to about it and I thought it was interesting. I'm not at all upset that I can't drink anymore. It's good that my body is holding me back.",20,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholism/comments/1j6wbu2/alcohol_is_so_disgusting_to_me_now/,Alcohol disgusting used really bad drinking problem Like went Id get bottle bad drinking almost every day sometimes every day isnt really issue finally beat shit alcoholism didnt use therapy anything shocked quitting essentially Anyway half year since drank heavily went friends day bar 2 beers friend offered shots alcoholic brain said oh hell yeah like 2 hours afterwards couldnt drink anything move suddenly without immediate urge throw Completely sober trying throw alcohol feeling pathetic found thanking God body whomever thank making easy pick drinking find drinking MAX 2 beers like every month go Ill feel atrocious want go bed Idk Im making post dont really anybody talk thought interesting Im upset cant drink anymore good body holding back

1jhi1j0,alcoholism,2025-03-22 20:36:10,Scared of missing it when I stop,"Social anxiety definitely helped get me hooked on drinking. I’ve started socially branching out a bit; I joined a softball team and a DnD campaign. I’m terrified to do either of those things if I can’t at least have a couple of shots to calm me down/feel comfortable being myself. For my job, when I have to meet with clients, I do my best to get a drink or two in first. 

I know I’ve officially crossed the line between social disordered drinking and full-blown alcoholism. I want to have a child soon, and I want to stop now. But I’m scared of not having fun, not being fun, and FOMO when others around me drink. 

I know that I’m not somebody that can moderate my drinking. If I start again, I’ll binge. The idea that I won’t be able to drink again terrifies me. 

Just typing this makes me want to get myself some alcohol.

Arrested and now with a record 
Hospitalizations
Lost jobs 
Lost money 
Lost trust 
Countless regretful mornings. 

I’ve been to rehab, I’m currently in counseling, but I really have to be honest with myself and ask if I really want to stop. 

I’ve created so much destruction in my life, that I don’t even feel the need to WANT to get better, because that would allow happiness in my life, and that’s something I don’t deserve. 

Unbelievably my wife, who is a rock, is still with me and still wanting me to get better even though she would have every right to leave. 

On top of all of this, I’m turning 40 in a few months, and it’s hitting me hard. 

I shouldn’t be here. Jobless, broke, still fighting addiction. 

I’m not sure what I’m asking for. Just needed to vent.

1j4bu2j,alcoholism,2025-03-05 19:39:48,My Cousin Went Crazy Today—Is This the End for Him?,"I’m reaching out to this community because I’m really worried about my cousin, who has been battling alcoholism for the past six years. He’s never liked drinking, but after so much time, he feels completely trapped in a cycle of addiction. On top of that, he has significant mental health issues, and he lost his mother a while ago, which has only deepened his struggles.

Today, his behavior was really concerning. He was talking constantly, repeating words over and over, and even making a song out of them. He was jumping around in the bathroom, laughing uncontrollably—though it was forced, almost like a nervous laughter. He was narrating random, nonsensical stories, smiling in a way that didn’t feel normal. This isn’t the way he usually behaves. He’s normally calm and thoughtful, but today he was completely out of character.

He’s been becoming more antisocial lately, and despite me being the only one visiting him, he still feels incredibly lonely. He’s tried therapy, but it hasn’t helped much, and he often feels like he’s beyond saving. He has also mentioned feeling like he might end it all, though not directly. I’m really scared for him, but I don’t know what to do anymore.

I love him deeply, and I’m doing everything I can to support him, but I can’t fix this alone. I’m looking for any advice, support, or resources—whether it’s therapy recommendations, strategies to help him when he spirals, or even just emotional support from people who understand what this is like.

I’m open to any suggestions, even if they’re hard to hear.

I wish I could erase the whole night. 

I’m so tired of regretting things. It’s ruining my life. It feels like I have to keep apologizing for my actions that don’t even feel like my own actions, if that makes sense. I don’t remember doing it and I never act like that sober. It’s a different version of myself that I hate. I don’t drink super often, maybe once a week or less.

I did have some minor withdrawal symptoms like the shakes, and that was about it. I did it without any medical attention or rehab/therapy, just willpower. Looking back, not having a medical team monitoring my withdrawal was probably a really dumb idea, but luckily it worked out.

I did relapse a bit in January and February of this year, but was able to limit myself to a couple of little travel bottles at a time, a few days ago week. I didn't want to go down that rabbit hole again, so I decided to abstain again a couple of weeks ago.

I had really hoped I could say at the one year mark, that I made it a whole year without drinking, and pat myself on the back.

I did pat myself on the back anyway and said to myself, ""Good job man, you almost made it. Aim higher in 2025.""

Thanks for being here, y'all.",14,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholism/comments/1j0l8qn/i_hit_a_milestone_today/,hit milestone today Sort February 29th 2024 quit alcohol solid 20 years drinking least 350ml day every day rarely hungover sometimes still drunk next morning depending much drank minor withdrawal symptoms like shakes without medical attention rehabtherapy willpower Looking back medical team monitoring withdrawal probably really dumb idea luckily worked relapse bit January February year able limit couple little travel bottles time days ago week didnt want go rabbit hole decided abstain couple weeks ago really hoped could say one year mark made whole year without drinking pat back pat back anyway said Good job man almost made Aim higher 2025 Thanks yall

I heard changes in diet can help with these cravings. I know it won’t work a miracle, but I’m trying whatever I can to help. I have a lot of faith in him, because he’s a really smart and capable guy. Have any diet changes helped anyone in recovery? Eating more of one thing and less of another? He already eats pretty well, and exercises a LOT. 

Because of his addiction, he’s in a halfway house, and I see/call him very rarely. He complains about craving alcohol a lot, and sneaks out to drink because his cravings are really bad. I have NO idea how he does this, but I really want him to stop. I’m planning on seeing him more often, and because of that, I plan on making him homemade treats to try and curb his appetite for alcohol, and make him feel more loved than he thinks he is. I care about him a lot. :(

My twin sister is married to an alcoholic. They have two young children. He has been to rehab twice but really has no desire to be sober, he tells her that he can drink socially but when he does he gets black out drunk and locks himself out etc. She is the breadwinner as he can’t keep a job and won’t apply to one. She works on weekends and during the week and on holidays. On top of that she carries the burden of scheduling all appointments and feeds the infant at all hours of night. 

I live close by so i am the first person she calls to get support but im starting to feel like Im enabling her bc im the only one in the family who knows beside his dad who also enables him. Does anyone know what advice i should give? i’ve suggested she make him move out until he gets his act together but she doesn’t feel like she can force him to move out. i’ve also encouraged her to get therapy and tell our parents but she lacks the time for therapy and doesn’t want to worry our parents.

Alcohol has always been present in my life, even as a young child I grew up with an alcoholic mother, no father around. I watched my mother drink every single day of her life. A year ago she died in large parts because of her relationship with Alcohol. 

I've always wanted to NOT be like her, but here I am. Ruining my relationship with my kids, my husband and I was still choosing alcohol. 

Until, last night, when my oldest child ran away because they are tired of me... Of my drinking. (My child was found safe). I sat in the hospital all night, in the waiting room, and they wouldn't let me see my child, I've slept maybe two hours, and I am not even mad at my kiddo, I am mad at myself. How did it get this far? And what do I do now? I have spent hours googling rehabs, recovery programs, what to watch out for during the withdrawals.

1jlj59j,alcoholism,2025-03-28 01:05:36,My brother relapsed on alcohol after suffering from delirium tremens months ago and idk if to confront him?,"I thought he was sober after such a scary health scare that landed him in the hospital when he went cold turkey after excessive drinking. He was in the hospital for 6 days, I was so scared he’d end up dead or with brain damage. It also hurt to see my stressed parents be there day and night by his side, praying he’d be ok. 

He made it out, said he’d go to AAA and get his life together. He started a good job shortly after and he seemed to be in a great space. Heck, he even started treating his ADHD through a psychiatrist. 

Things seemed like they were really turning around for him, that is until I noticed little old habits trickle in. When he would drink he’d call me almost non stop, just to banter or entertain him. If I tried to get off the phone it would offend him and I’ve noticed recently he’s been calling me more again. Even during hours I told him I’m sleeping and can’t answer his calls. He also once again, gets offended if I can’t answer or have to get off the phone. I think should also add he often calls me because he finds the most comfort or understanding from me out of all our family members.

When he would drink he also wouldn’t want to do anything but stay at home and watch movies or blast music. He seems to be doing 
this again as well. There’s also a certain tone he has in his voice when he’s not sober, which I’ve pointed out to him. Lately his answer to that is that he’s just smoking weed. That was also his excuse a year ago when he got out of rehab. Back then we gave him the benefit of the doubt but sadly we found he our fears he was drinking were true when he was in the hospital 3 months ago. 

My suspicions were confirmed two weeks ago when his roommates admitted to my sister he was indeed drinking, but he said “only a little!”. My brother shouldn’t be drinking at all. 

My younger brother has been an alcoholic for years. He’s in his mid 20s, it really depresses and agitates me that he can’t seem to get sober. He has busted his teeth and had to get veneers over a drinking incident, he’s busted his hands over a drinking incident, he’s had hard times holding down a job because he can’t tolerate people which I tie to his alcoholism, refuses to go to therapy, he’s having problems in his new job, and every time I ask him if he’s going to AAA or therapy he changes to subject or flat out gets mad and just hangs up on me.

He really believed just being busy with a job will be enough to keep him sober. Whenever I suggest being more active like getting a hobby, being more physically active or doing things that won’t keep him cooped at home he ends up just shutting me down.  

I’m tired, idk if to just flat out tell him I know he’s drinking. Or to tell him I don’t want to talk to him until I know he’s completely sober, yet I get worried something horrible will happen again if I’m not there for him.

I’m also angry at my parents for helping him out when he’s tight on cash for the rent or groceries. I just don’t trust that money being used the way they think it is.

I don’t know what else to do, or if I’m going about this the right way at all.

1jdgecc,alcoholism,2025-03-17 16:10:21,Happy st Patrick’s Day at 16 years sober.,"Hello all and Happy St Patrick’s day. Today I have been sober for 16 years. 

Over that time I made myself some guidelines to help and remind me of what I need to do. Just having the perspective and written down rules has helped me. 

1. You have to want to quit.

All the self-help books and all the support groups in the world are not going to help you if you don't actually want to quit.

2. Find a reason to quit.

Any reason outside of yourself that can make you accountable. Start small and build from there. Responsibility can be a hell of a driving force when it’s something you care about.

3. Redirect the the urge to something beneficial.

As an addict I have the superhuman ability to pour all of myself into something that gives me joy.
Replacing the bad behaviors with something
improves your current situation can help while keeping you busy.

4. Never get bored.

I'm a machine of habit when I get bored I get back into whatever habit that's easiest for me. Building new habits takes time don’t give up.

5. If needed remove the people and things that allow you to continue the addiction.

This one sucks. It hurts to lose someone that was close to you but when the people around you aren't helping you, or in some cases actively hurting you, then you need to think about what you really need to do and sometimes that means cutting people out. This goes for physical locations and inanimate objects as well.

6. Find anything that works for you.

What works for you may not help someone else. What works for me might seem alien and totally unreasonable to somebody else but as long as it keeps me clean then that's what I need to do.

7. Get help if you need it.

You don't have to do this alone. If you feel yourself falter or begin to fail there are thousands of people that know how to help and might even know exactly what you are going through. You just have to look.

8. It doesn’t all have to be the perfect.

You can still be a mess and be sober. Everyday  sober  is better even if you aren’t the best. At least you know you’re trying.


Sooooo….,
I had to invoke my fifth rule this last year. I quit my Job. Without going into the nitty gritty of it all I worked at a smaller business of about 5 people total and to put it mildly they were not sober. I loved that job. I liked the guys I worked with but it became clear to me that they were not healthy for me to be around.  One of them may even have been dealing. Needless to say as soon as I found out the extent of the substance abuse going on behind the scenes I left the next day.   It all turned out for the better. I got a new job with less toxic people and I’m much happier here than the four years I was at my other job.  It can be rough sometimes. It may even seem impossible but you will still be better without the people that destroy you and simply do not care about you. 

From my experience Narcissistic and addictive behaviors tend to come together in the more extreme cases of abuse and you may not even be aware of it until after you’ve removed them from your life.  It is important to take stock of the things around you and regularly check if it’s healthy and helpful. Otherwise you get stuck in your patterns again and it is so damn hard to get out of them. 

Sorry for the word vomit but i think it was important for me to at least talk about following my own advice. 

You are all awesome.
You can do this.
Never get bored and never stop.
Good luck to all of you and Happy St. Patrick's Day",11,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholism/comments/1jdgecc/happy_st_patricks_day_at_16_years_sober/,Happy st Patricks Day 16 years sober Hello Happy St Patricks day Today sober 16 years time made guidelines help remind need perspective written rules helped 1 want quit selfhelp books support groups world going help dont actually want quit 2 Find reason quit reason outside make accountable Start small build Responsibility hell driving force something care 3 Redirect urge something beneficial addict superhuman ability pour something gives joy Replacing bad behaviors something improves current situation help keeping busy 4 Never get bored Im machine habit get bored get back whatever habit thats easiest Building new habits takes time dont give 5 needed remove people things allow continue addiction one sucks hurts lose someone close people around arent helping cases actively hurting need think really need sometimes means cutting people goes physical locations inanimate objects well 6 Find anything works works may help someone else works might seem alien totally unreasonable somebody else long keeps clean thats need 7 Get help need dont alone feel falter begin fail thousands people know help might even know exactly going look 8 doesnt perfect still mess sober Everyday sober better even arent best least know youre trying Sooooo invoke fifth rule last year quit Job Without going nitty gritty worked smaller business 5 people total put mildly sober loved job liked guys worked became clear healthy around One may even dealing Needless say soon found extent substance abuse going behind scenes left next day turned better got new job less toxic people Im much happier four years job rough sometimes may even seem impossible still better without people destroy simply care experience Narcissistic addictive behaviors tend come together extreme cases abuse may even aware youve removed life important take stock things around regularly check healthy helpful Otherwise get stuck patterns damn hard get Sorry word vomit think important least talk following advice awesome Never get bored never stop Good luck Happy St Patricks Day
1j9zyya,alcoholism,2025-03-13 00:56:35,Maybe you need to hear this-,"I do apologize if this is the wrong place (I really don't post on reddit a lot) but the about mentioned those who knew someone suffering from alcoholism were welcome. 

Keyword- knew. 

Almost two weeks ago I was awoken by my mother to inform me my brother had been found dead in his apartment. He was 39- just had moved to attend some classes. Some sort of certification for a job. He was trying to turn it all around for the umpteenth time.

He had been to rehab and prison. He had been to doctors and on various medications. He had been told if he didn't stop drinking the way he was that he would die. He'd go through periods of being sober. Periods of time where I had my brother back. The brother that remembered my birthdays. The brother that could make just about any piece of furniture from scratch. The brother that helped me get my current job. Then, he was gone again. Someone I could no longer recognize. Angry. Manipulative. 

Anything for a drink. 

I thought the move would help. I had hope that maybe this time would be different- and it was. Just. Not in the way I hoped it would be. On one hand, I'm relieved. He's safe now. No worry of him driving drunk and taking himself out or someone else. On the other, I'm angry. At him, at the universe, at the situation. It all seems so unfair. Alcohol robbed him of his life, it robbed me of him. 

I find myself lying awake at night wondering if there was something more I could have done. If there was something that would have made the difference. Probably- infinitesimally. While I can no longer do anything to help him I can do something for him. Maybe hearing his story will help you in your struggle. Maybe you've got someone like me in your life. Maybe you don't. If you don't then I'll gladly be that person right here, right now. I want to help others still fighting the battle my brother lost. Maybe, I can spare someone this pain, this emptiness. 

Even if it is just one. 

How do I help others battling this addiction? How can I keep another sister out there from burying their brother?

1jh6h3q,stopdrinking,2025-03-22 11:35:49,It happened to me,"Welp, it happened to me. I thought these stories were hyperbole or sometimes made up. 

I was at a get together with close friends. Not drinking. People do not know I am ""sober"" per say, but they know I am on a ""health kick,"" which includes not drinking. 

I was being offered a drink by a stubborn party: ""A normal beer. No this is your favourite beer. What about a light beer then?"" I wriggled out it replying that beer seems to flare my IBS ( which it does.) 

I said I would prefer a soft drink (soda.) He then offered a ginger beer (for all you non-Australians if you have not had Bundaberg Ginger Beer you have not lived.) I assumed he meant the common non-alcoholic variety. I was brought a glass which did not taste quite the way I expected. But on the other hand, I could not smell alcohol either. After a couple of sips I was convinced something was not right, went searching for the can, and sure enough it was an alcoholic ginger beer. 

I was faced with a choice. I could feel the tiniest bubble of buzz forming after even a few sips. ""well just one can't hurt"", ""well it was not my fault, I tried to refuse...."" but in the end I decided to leave the cup un-drunk on the table. I remembered how alcohol can claw its way back into my life after one ""controlled"" experience. Within months I am finding new rock bottoms. 

So I successfully passed this test. But the only reason I passed this time was because of the number of times I have failed in the past. I remember my many dalliances with ""moderation.""

1j2y9o7,stopdrinking,2025-03-04 00:40:43,Being an alcoholic is like self inflicting a chronic pain condition,"It’s 7am on a Tuesday. You’ve hit snooze 3 times and only have 30 minutes to get to work. There is only a shot or two left in the bottle of four roses you bought last night. It feels like you’ve been shot in the stomach. Your jaw is constantly clinching and clicking and aching. Having a headache is a usual part of your day now. Lips red and cracked, eyes bloodshot, face puffy. You are so, so tired. You smoke a cigarette and it sets you over the edge. You puke. Shower, brush teeth, off to work. 

You’re late and fuck up all day. You’re anxious to a debilitating, almost delusional degree and think everyone hates you. It’s clear you’re strung out and sick. You’re depressed and every negative thought is stuck on a loop. You’re so nauseous you can’t eat. 

You get off work and get more booze. It doesn’t really give you the release you expect and crave; you’ll feel normal again for an hour or so, after that, numb. And still very sick. You DoorDash something and nibble at it. You don’t enjoy it. Drink until you sleep. Next days the same. 

Writing this down just to remember why I quit.

1jl7i62,stopdrinking,2025-03-27 16:06:58,"1,000 days sober today.  Here’s what worked. And continues to work for me.","I'm 1,000 days sober today. Heading to 3 years in July. Here's what has helped me:

• Cherry pick the advice you see here, in books, and elsewhere. Hit upon the right mix of tools that work for you. Like trying a few combinations on a safe door before it clunks open.

• Fast forward the tape. How will having a drink now affect me tomorrow morning? What's happened before? A slide back into what? It’s a good way to remind yourself to be kinder to yourself, and that you have the power to remove yourself from the torture.

• Don't 'white knuckle it' this time. Use other ways to deal with the pangs and they will become thoughts you can bat away, quicker and quicker each time. 

Find techniques like 'fast forward the tape' that work for you. I found 'urge surfing' really useful in my first two weeks. Delay, Distract, Decide is gold, too. Worth googling.

A change of environment works wonders. Go out for a drive or a walk or a coffee. Call a friend and get into talking about something else.

• Know that it only takes 10 days for alcohol to leave your body (See EDIT below). Then it's not alcohol you're addicted to - it's the thought of it. It's the misconceptions you have about it. There is some de-brainwashing to do.

• Be patient with yourself. I used to say, 'I want to get sober quick, like in a movie montage'! Hang on in there - while you've got to stay vigilant, it does get easier too.

Recognise that you want fast results. As drinkers, we're used to quick fixes. (I used to joke, ‘I downloaded the app, why do I still get pangs?!’) You'll look at the time gone by and wish you could leap forward to six months or a year and be done with it. Know that you will get there, even if you can't make the clock hands spin faster.

• Lots of people who drink go from using-to-feel-happy to using-to-feel-nothing. I believe that long-term recovery is all about finding peace in other ways. Could be as simple as starting or re-starting a hobby, trying guided meditation. Or even changing jobs or addresses. The old cliche is true: it’s a change of lifestyle not a life sentence.

• Books! A lot of people recommend This Naked Mind. However, I found a lot of brilliant practical advice in The 10 Day Alcohol Detox. Also, for  entertainment and empathy, The Unexpected Joy of Being Sober made me laugh and stay on track.

• Keep your webcam and microphone off if you want to at first, but attend an online meeting. Doesn't have to be AA. There are lots of different types out there. Try a few. This will let you connect with others who 'get it'. Such a relief. And a reassurance knowing you can experience something and go back and tell them, and get understanding.

'The opposite of addiction is connection' didn't make sense to me at first. It does now.

• Celebrate the wins. One day at a time - or even one hour at a time if you have to, at first. Count the days, the money saved (and use it to buy yourself treats), the calories if you like. Use an app on your phone. iamdonedrinking.com is good. iamsober.com also has communities of people at the same stage of recovery as you. One day... one week.. etc etc.

• Don't be afraid to protect yourself; your recovery. Walk away if you need to. Go into another room or leave the building if a situation is not right for you. Your circle of friends may change a little. You will know that, 'You lie with dogs, you get fleas'! 

For the first year or so, I didn’t go out much, while I was finding my way. Now I turn up to some parties if there are new/good people there, get interested in them, join in fun conversations, etc ...but when things get too lairy I go - my time's too precious to be bored by pissed people :-)

• Enjoy waking up without a hangover. Drive somewhere late at night. Explore doing stuff you couldn't before. As you heal, your attractions change too. Toxicity stops looking like excitement, peace stops looking like boredom.

• Your sleep gets better. You’ll gain more time in the day. These days I naturally wake and get up an hour before my alarm and read or do something else I want to before my workday begins - no hungover rush any more.

• Complexion gets better. My face was puffy - it isn’t now. It’s easier to concentrate and communicate. Work’s easier. Relationships so, so much better.

• Make a list of all the crap you had to put up with when you were a drinker. The hangovers, the zombie hours, blackouts? Sneakiness? All of it. Doesn’t apply any more. Keep a healthy memory of it (in other words, don't focus on regret but remember not to go back)

• Use the extra time you gain. 'If only there were more hours in the day' - now there are! Get into something that you enjoy and absorbs you. Could be something you abandoned a while back, something you've always wanted to get round to doing, or something completely new. A hobby, a pastime ...and don't feel guilty for spending time on yourself.

• Enjoy! Not having to drink any more feels so much better than any drink tastes. Enjoy your new life, remembering to glance over your shoulder occasionally so you don’t want to go back.

It's all about de-programming ourselves, I believe, and finding happier ways to live. 

It really does get easier, as your mindfulness and vigilance just become second nature, urges decrease, and you reap more and more benefits.


EDIT: Double checked this, as a couple of people have questioned it in the comments. Talking to a clinician, I'm told that actually alcohol can be detected up to 24 hours if you go by a breath test, up to 5 days if you go by a urine test, or up to 90 days if you go by a hair strand test. The bigger point is that I think there are two kinds of addiction at play: the chemical addiction and the psychological addiction.

In my experience, the chemical one goes pretty quickly and the psychological one is where you can 'de-brainwash' yourself to suceed.

For example, how many times have you heard someone in a movie or on TV say, 'I need a drink'? We're bombarded with the normalisation of alcohol abuse all the time.

And why do people drink to try and make themselves more energetic and interesting at parties ('a livener' which is often a precursor to things getting messy pretty quickly!), but also drink to relax and go to sleep ('a nightcap' to have by the fire and 'help you sleep', even though your sleep is shit when you've been drinking)?

That's the focus of my point here; we need to call out the bullshit in our heads to avoid being a sucker to it!

1j93441,stopdrinking,2025-03-11 22:07:35,I fcking did it!,"On March 9, 2025 I celebrated ONE MF’N YEAR of sobriety! 

It has likely been 20+ years since I have gone an entire year without a drop of alcohol, but 2020-2024 was absolute hell on earth. I became a full blown alcoholic. Never thought that would be me. Always told myself I knew better, I knew when to stop. That I knew when I had gone too far. Until I didn’t. 

I attempted sobriety (like - truly attempted to stop, not “cut back”) from August 2023 to mid October 2023. I was doing great until, in one day (within a few hours of each other), I found out my father had taken his life and that I was going to be saying goodbye to my soul dog of 17 years. Easily the absolute worst time of my life. I held out for two more weeks after those tragedies … then I gave in. I didn’t think it was possible for it to get worse, but somehow it did. From October 2023 to March 2024 I was basically black out drunk all.the.time. I have no clue how I kept my job (I work from home - not great for an alcoholic …), but I guess I managed to keep it together enough to do what I needed to do. I don’t even know what happened in March 2024, what made me finally say I can’t do this anymore, but something shifted. I woke up with the usual hangxiety and thought, “this has to stop.” I put that shit down and haven’t touched it since. 

I won’t lie and say everything is rainbows 🌈 and ponies 🐴 now. I still have anxiety. I still struggle with depression at times. But I can say with 100% honesty that ditching alcohol has made those things easier to deal with. My marriage is better. My health is better. MY LIFE IS BETTER. 

Sobriety is worth it. YOU are worth it.

1j22jyk,stopdrinking,2025-03-02 21:53:10,"Sober for 8 Years now, and still havent figured it out.","I stopped drinking 8 years ago, after I went heli skiing and broke loads of bones and didnt have access to alcohol in the hospital, where I was for 4 weeks.

I told them I was an alcoholic and they tapered me down with clomethiazole (way better than benzos in my opinion, but Ive never heard of American hospitals using that. In Germany its sold under the brand name ""Distraneurin"").

Since then I havent touched a single drink.

Regarding my physical health, I have improved a lot. I regularly do  Krav Maga, swim more than a kilometre multiple times a week, but Ive never found something to take the place of alcohol.

Ive done therapy, Ive tried getting into meditation, but nothing worked.

Until today, Ive never found something that calms me down as much as alcohol did.

I havent really ""chilled"" or felt at ease for 8 years. I dont know what Im doing wrong.

I work a great job, make great money, my marriage is happy, but ever since ive stopped drinking, I havent ""chilled"" at all.


How do you become at peace? How do you truly get to a point where you can just relax and wind down without the help of alcohol/weed/other downers.

Does anyone sometimes think that life was shittier when they were still drinking, but still fondly look back on situations where alcohol was the ultimate mood enhancer?

Sorry for my rambling, its past my bed time, just wondering if anyone else knows what I feel like?

1j9h9t4,stopdrinking,2025-03-12 10:49:27,I’m a 40f binge-drinker and impostor,"Weird way to introduce myself, but I made this account to try being honest with somebody/anybody. So I will type, and cry, and try to light a small candle of hope.

I’m married with two kids (5f and 7f). We have a house and a cabin, so life should be great. Except it isn’t, and I am just *so tired*. Tired of the neverending story that is my life.

I binge, on alcohol and/or food, and have been since I was 17. I have an eating disorder (bulimia) which is just the cherry on top of being an alcoholic mom. My food issues are linked to stress and depression. My alcohol issues are linked to life. I was hospitalized and diagnosed as bipolar in my 20s, after which I quit other substances since i was unable to smoke or snort my life better - I never gave up alcohol though, because *alcohol is legal, right?*

I finished my bachelor last summer, and am currently taking my master degree (law school). Saying it is stressful is an understatement, and even though I somehow do well in school I don’t *feel* well. I am overwhelmed. All the time.

My husband is kind, quiet and naive. He has an underdeveloped sense of empathy, and often spaces out, so he is unable to understand how people around him feel or experience their life. I communicate my feelings, but it is difficult for him to grasp since he can’t relate. I am telling you this, so you understand why I will not involve him in my sobriety issues. He would want to support me, and I would resent him for not understanding.

I mostly drink beer. And, being an impostor, I vary which grocery stores I buy it from. My husband likes beer too, but he can drink however few or many he wants to. I try to restrain myself when he’s awake, so that I don’t consume more than twice of what he drinks. When he goes to bed though, I get two hours to myself where all bets are off. I’ll easily have 6-10 beers on a regular night, and 8-12 during the weekends.

I hate how grumpy I am in the mornings, and how I just want to be allowed to drink my beer in peace on weekends. I usually have my first weekend-beer around 3/4pm when I start dinner, but I don’t start drinking in earnest until my kids are off to bed. I love my family, they deserve better. 

My proudest moment this week was going to bed at 8pm yesterday instead of opening a bottle on wine, which I find quite embarrassing to be honest. My first goal is to have more sober days than drunk days. Sorry for the shit goal, but at least iwndwyt.

I had high blood pressure, was throwing up almost every day (throwing up nothing but blood was normal to me), had a loud cough, skipped 2-3 meals a day because I was drinking, liver enzymes were close to 300.  My eyes had a yellow tint.  

I was in the midst of a severe health crisis battling an unwavering addiction.  

Next week I will cross 1 year alcohol-free.  

Recently, I did blood work with my doctor, to which he said “Overall, these labs look great and show that you are in good health!”

Because of the years of high blood pressure, I did an echocardiogram for my heart, which showed normal function and size.  

Today, I completed an ultrasound of my liver and kidneys.  No fatty liver nor scarring.  Perfectly normal.  The human body can be truly resilient.

Last night, I was at my older brother's house and he had recently gotten sober. I asked him why he was drinking beer and he told me it was a non alcoholic one because he likes the taste and poured me about a quarter cup. I smelled it. Yep, smells like beer. I tasted it, yup, tastes like beer. 

Then right after the first sip I got a huge rush of anxiety. I haven't had anxiety like that since prior to quitting. It's like every nerve in my body fired at once and I had to step out for a minute to calm down. Even knowing it was non-alcoholic didn't help. I could down the entire case and not feel a buzz. It didn't matter and it felt like a full-body rejection of what I was doing. On the one hand, I was embarrassed, I used to drink a few 40s a day, now one little sip sends me over the edge?

1j4fxsb,stopdrinking,2025-03-05 22:24:58,Life is so much better without alcohol - 8 months sober,"On July 8th, 2024 I was sitting in my car during my lunch break after drinking alcohol everyday for the past three years. There I was on the phone with my dad when I started crying about my drinking. I told my dad I really wanted to quit, I wanted to be a better mom for my daughter. I was tired of being sick and tired, letting alcohol control my every single move and thought. I remember right before quitting I had a hair appointment right after work and stopped at a liquor store and drank in the parking lot before my appointment because the thought of sitting through the appointment without booze was excruciating. 

It wasn’t easy but it has been so worth it. My anxiety was so freaking bad and today I can say that it manageable. I am a better parent today, more present, calm, happier, responsible. I have been able to focus on my health and get my finances in order, pay off debts and started therapy. My marriage is better than it was when I was drinking. I’ve been able to make and actually go to doctor’s appointments. I’ve taken up actual hobbies like reading, cross words, walking. I’ve just been able to enjoy life and the little things. My anger is under control. Quitting alcohol gave me the strength to quit nicotine and more recently weed.

1jjjp6m,stopdrinking,2025-03-25 13:45:09,I finally did it. I've been alcohol free for 4 days!!!,"  Im so proud of myself. I finally went to the doctors after an insane panic attack over my constant 3 years of drinking (I drank about a bottle and a half of vodka/whiskey a week). I went in crying my eyes out, and explained everything. They quickly told me I need to be on anxiety medication and need to stop. They put me on an anti drinking pill (it diverts my brain from seeking alcohol) and told me to go cold turkey. At first I was hesitant, do to the things I've heard about quitting cold turkey, but they said I was young and didn't have multiple years of drinking an entire bottle daily and I would be fine. Here I am on day 4 of no drinking, and I have not felt this happy since 2021. 

For those wondering- my first 24 hours without alcohol was the absolute worse. I literally felt like I had the flu (I didn't have a fever though) and couldn't stop vomiting absolutely nothing. I was so scared and nervous, but I think my nerves is what made it worse. I've always heard the first 48 hours were the worst, but by day 2 I was already starting to feel soooo much better. Day 3 I'd say I felt a little worse than day 2, but I got through it. Here I am on day 4! I'm a little sweaty still, and my anxiety is still making me itchy, but I can feel my body thanking me for stopping. It's time to turn my life around for good 💖

Also- I feel like I need to say do not go cold turkey unless your doctor says so. I've heard some very scary stories about going cold turkey when not advised to. 


EDIT- I am crying over this support. I have been in this community for over 3 months, ever since I had my first big drunk ""uh oh"" and ruined my relationship with my BFF. I would try to go a day without alcohol, then absolutely fail to make it 12 hours without it. I'm not going to lie, without this community I may have still been slamming shots daily, ruining my relationships, and having achy organs (so excited for that to go away, my heart, stomach, and back hurt 24/7 cause of the drinking). Now I get to start again and I just couldn't say thank you all enough 💖💖💖

1jimgv8,stopdrinking,2025-03-24 09:12:03,If you're feeling tempted to drink moderately...,"Managed almost 3 months sober and ruined it on Friday night. Thankfully I didn't drink to excess or black out or anything. Only had 1 beer on Friday and 3 on Saturday. No regretful behaviour this time thankfully, but I still regret doing it.

  
For those of you who feel tempted to drink moderately, let me tell you how it went:

* Went to a social event without telling people I wasn't drinking (first mistake). I got there and felt embarrassed about ordering NA beer (stupid I know) and also felt that I'd have more fun if I got tipsy, so I ordered a regular beer

* Now feeling tired, anxious, miserable and disappointed in myself, and have no motivation whatsoever for the working week

1jk2e2i,stopdrinking,2025-03-26 03:15:47,I’ve ruined my liver at 25,"I’m 25 years old, and have drank almost daily since I was 20. Between 22-25 my tolerance drastically increased, and at times I was drinking earlier and earlier in the day. Last year I had lab work done but my doctor stated that my liver enzymes were barely elevated and it could have been caused by the Tylenol I was taking for my cold. 

Fast forward to last week— I am not someone who gets hangovers, and I woke up throwing up dark red blood and nothing else nonstop. My friend came and took me to the ER where I was diagnosed with gastritis. When running labs, my liver enzymes were so elevated that my AST levels were at 260, when the normal range is 0-45. When an ultrasound was done they noticed fatty build up in my liver. 

I have been sober 1 week now, and despite having no real withdrawal symptoms I was on the verge of a panic attack for my first 24 hours due to the fear that I may have caused irreversible damage to my organs. 

Any time I’ve wanted a drink in the last 7 days, all I’ve done is look at my lab results and ultrasound description. I’m fucking 25 and I almost gave myself cirrhosis—and I never would have had a clue had I not thrown up blood. 

PLEASE get your labs done frequently. Monitor your liver health. There’s still a chance my liver doesn’t regenerate in the damaged parts. 

I have been a “functioning” alcoholic for years, but I think this is my final wake up call. Nothing more terrifying and humbling that vomiting puke in an ER waiting room.

1j8bosc,stopdrinking,2025-03-10 22:41:45,My weekend routine as a binge drinker.,"I (27M) hate that I do this. This is like, a weekly routine for me. Friday night I wanna party it up and have a few drinks, so my wife and I get our drank on. She is capable of stopping once she starts. Must be nice. We split a fifth of vodka and we’re having our fun, then I get a 6 pack to keep the party going for myself as the night continues. I live next door to the grocery store, so it’s a very present temptation. By the end of the night I’m pretty slammed. Not to mention hitting the vape like an absolute fiend.

Saturday I wake up with that hyper feeling you get when the booze didn’t let you sleep and your body is on like hyperdrive mode. I get up at like 7 and I feel kinda unhinged, like I’m totally invincible and have no cares in the world. I’m ready for another drink. Now if there’s wine, if I didn’t finish my beers the previous night, whatever’s in the house, it’s going down. We’ll probably go get lunch somewhere, so that’ll be another 3 beers. I’ll stop at the store again, just so I know I have some more beer if the craving hits me tonight. As soon as I’m through the door, I’m drinking them.

By now my wife will usually tell me, warn me the direction I’m heading in. This time’s different. I don’t feel delirious at all, and I didn’t have THAT much, and I’m having so much fun, can you pleeeease just not get onto me about this right now? “No, seriously, you’re gonna crash after the weekend and have a pity party again. I want to drink with you but it’s time to stop. We’ve been here before.”

So suddenly I’m needing to use the bathroom or step over into my office a lot because I brought a beer in there and I’m sneaking a few gulps whenever I go. I’m having the time of my life. But at some point I get really tired. Maybe it was the 3 hours of shit-grade sleep, or the 30 drinks so far this weekend, but I go out like a light and sleep the whole night through. I wake up the next day and I’m in trouble.

I *need* a drink right now. It’s not keeping me hyper now, in fact my energy level is dropping, my appetite is minimal, I’m starting to notice there’s a mess around the house because of all the activity through the weekend, but the last thing I want to do is clean it. I chalk it up to a “lazy Sunday” and hungrily drink anything else I can find in the house. LUCKILY at this stage I don’t feel up to drive. My stomach is getting upset and the drinking is only delaying it. Not really having so much fun. Not to mention that I work the next day… and my anxiety is sky-high. I have to be all ready and recovered, ready to be a professional? I’m covered in sweat, haven’t showered or changed underwear in three days, I’ve jerked off 8 times today to distract from my discomfort, and I’m trying to stretch my tongue to the bottom of a wine glass to get the last drop out. I ain’t feeling professional.

Then it’s the dreaded bed time. My wife tries to comfort me, knowing I’m in pain but knowing I clearly did this to myself. She encourages me not to call out of work tomorrow. Calling out every other Monday is an atrocious look and I know it. But it’s midnight, and I’m feeling like shit, and the shivers are setting in, and I have to be up in 6 hours, and I just CANNOT get to sleep. I stay up on my phone until it’s time to go. I email my boss with some excuse I can’t come in. Then I get about an hour of uncomfortable sleep. I wake up knowing it’ll be the worst day of the cycle.

Death. My stomach is killing me. All the booze is out of my system and I don’t love it. I’m sweating but freezing. Every mistake I’ve ever made comes back to me. How many drinks did I have, like 40? The trash is full of bottles and cans. I’m thirsty, but getting water is too much of a task and my stomach is too upset anyway. Suddenly I remember how many times I’ve been in this situation before. Dozens and dozens of times. How many of these do I get before my liver shrivels into a raisin and my poor loving wife just finds me dead? Before I get cancer or kidney damage or alcoholic hepatitis or something? The clarity is terrifying. I swear I’ll never drink again. I can’t even enjoy a little liquor with the wife on Fridays because it gets out of hand every time.

I see what a mess I’ve made and how bad I must look to her right now. I try to apologize and promise I’m gonna turn around and never drink again and get back into the gym and start spending my free time on hobbies, not on this slow suicide, that I swear this time is different and I’ll never get like that again. She stopped believing that ages ago. This is just part of sharing life with me, and I need to stop doing it against her wishes, ignoring when she says I’ve had enough, and then feeling sorry for myself when I crash and have this hangover. Well, she’s right. I don’t want to once again say “this time’s different.” Instead, I’ll say IWNDWYT. Wish me luck, because I’ve been trying to escape this for like 5 years now.",824,94,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/1j8bosc/my_weekend_routine_as_a_binge_drinker/,weekend routine binge drinker 27M hate like weekly routine Friday night wan na party drinks wife get drank capable stopping starts Must nice split fifth vodka fun get 6 pack keep party going night continues live next door grocery store present temptation end night Im pretty slammed mention hitting vape like absolute fiend Saturday wake hyper feeling get booze didnt let sleep body like hyperdrive mode get like 7 feel kinda unhinged like Im totally invincible cares world Im ready another drink theres wine didnt finish beers previous night whatevers house going Well probably go get lunch somewhere thatll another 3 beers Ill stop store know beer craving hits tonight soon Im door Im drinking wife usually tell warn direction Im heading times different dont feel delirious didnt much Im much fun pleeeease get onto right seriously youre gon na crash weekend pity party want drink time stop Weve suddenly Im needing use bathroom step office lot brought beer Im sneaking gulps whenever go Im time life point get really tired Maybe 3 hours shitgrade sleep 30 drinks far weekend go like light sleep whole night wake next day Im trouble need drink right keeping hyper fact energy level dropping appetite minimal Im starting notice theres mess around house activity weekend last thing want clean chalk lazy Sunday hungrily drink anything else find house LUCKILY stage dont feel drive stomach getting upset drinking delaying really much fun mention work next day anxiety skyhigh ready recovered ready professional Im covered sweat havent showered changed underwear three days Ive jerked 8 times today distract discomfort Im trying stretch tongue bottom wine glass get last drop aint feeling professional dreaded bed time wife tries comfort knowing Im pain knowing clearly encourages call work tomorrow Calling every Monday atrocious look know midnight Im feeling like shit shivers setting 6 hours get sleep stay phone time go email boss excuse cant come get hour uncomfortable sleep wake knowing itll worst day cycle Death stomach killing booze system dont love Im sweating freezing Every mistake Ive ever made comes back many drinks like 40 trash full bottles cans Im thirsty getting water much task stomach upset anyway Suddenly remember many times Ive situation Dozens dozens times many get liver shrivels raisin poor loving wife finds dead get cancer kidney damage alcoholic hepatitis something clarity terrifying swear Ill never drink cant even enjoy little liquor wife Fridays gets hand every time see mess Ive made bad must look right try apologize promise Im gon na turn around never drink get back gym start spending free time hobbies slow suicide swear time different Ill never get like stopped believing ages ago part sharing life need stop wishes ignoring says Ive enough feeling sorry crash hangover Well shes right dont want say times different Instead Ill say IWNDWYT Wish luck Ive trying escape like 5 years

I am turning 41 in May, and if all goes as planned, I will be 3 months sober on my birthday. 

I am doing it differently this time, meds & therapy & recovery groups. It's gotten so much easier than it was during all my other half-hearted attempts. I am feeling great, even though it is still early days - currently on day 19, but that's after a 1 day slip where I'd had a few weeks before that.

In therapy this week, I brought up my feeling of guilt I have that now that things are feeling good, that I am so upset it took me so long to get here. I have a lot of life left to live, I hope, but still hate all the wasted time. 

Who quit at 40 or older, and did you feel this way, too? What helped? We will be talking about it at my next therapy session and could use some support on the topic until then.

1j6cv2h,stopdrinking,2025-03-08 08:31:43,“Intellectualising” Alcohol Abuse,"I wanted to write about a phenomenon I’ve certainly been guilty of and I suspect others might have been too. We can call this “intellectualising” alcohol abuse.

What I mean by this is masking alcohol abuse behind a purported intellectual or artistic interest in a particular alcoholic drink. 

To give you my example, I once presented myself as a “connoisseur” of whisky. I joined a whisky club, paying £100s a year for rare whiskies. I built a collection of probably around 25-30 bottles worth over £1000. I visited whisky festivals (where I of course got black out drunk and made a fool of myself). I pretended I understood and appreciated the subtle differences between tasting notes, ages, barrels and whisky regions. 

All of this was a farce, where I was using money, art and taste to disguise alcohol abuse and present it as an intellectual interest. Recognising this and pouring all of these expensive bottles down the drain was liberating. 

Does anyone else have an experience like this? I think whisky is a common one, but obviously wine has been used like this for a long time. Interestingly, beer is also increasingly being used in this way. I suspect a lot of people who present an intellectual interest in craft beers, IPAs etc. may have alcohol problems.

1jmfy6a,stopdrinking,2025-03-29 06:07:16,Went to the ER.,"Last Saturday I went all out started with about 200 ml of whiskey in my coffee, then moved over and drank about 13 9% IPA's.  I went to bed at 830 pm that night stumbling drunk.  I woke up the next morning at 4 am and drank water to recover and I couldn't breathe, I wanted to puke but I was afraid because I couldn't swallow properly and was terrified I was going to choke on my vomit.  I immediately started having a anxiety/panic attack I said to myself I either lay down in bed and hope to ride this out or I go to the hospital.  

I went checked myself in I am sure they knew i was coming down because they admitted me stuck me in a room looked in my throat and said maybe strep throat but I doubt it.  Did their tests and literally left me in there from 430 am til 9 am alone sleeping.  The whole time I felt like my stomach was so full it would explode, but I wanted to drink water but knew if I did it would make my stomach worse or I'd puke, still not being able to swallow I had another panic attack alone in the ER.  I started having these terrible hot flashes my face got real hot like my body was trying it's damndest to push the alcohol up to my head and sweat out the poison.  After 9 am I drove back home and slept all day. I was so embarrassed I went to the ER but it was the wake up call I needed.  Alcohol free since last Sunday morning.

But, I hurt him. I kept hurting him. I let the monster out of the cage one last time while drinking, and he had enough. He said the things I’ve said have changed his view of me, and, “I wouldn’t make you choose between me and alcohol”. 

I pleaded and bargained, I’ll get my shit together, go back to therapy, sober meetings….

But it’s over. It’s really over.

1jjnvr1,stopdrinking,2025-03-25 16:44:44,"54M, 1 Year Sober Today, My Experience...","Hi There,

Today marks a year sober! I figure I would celebrate by making a post cuz other than that, it's just another day. Hopefully it helps someone. I had been drinking socially through my 20s and 30s then more in my 40s then more in my 50s then covid hit and my intake increased exponentially. On the outside I was ""high functioning"", successful, great family, inside I was hollow and drinking myself silly most nights, always starting after 5.. Tomorrow I'll start being sober I would say to myself each night, only to repeat the same cycle over and over. Got a DUI and stopped for a few months then went right back to the booze. I was tired of feeling like shit, not living up to my potential but not tired enough to stop. I decided to do dry January in 2024. I got through that and kept going until March then we went on vacation. The first couple days I was sober, then the 3rd I thought, I can reward myself on vaca, why not. Drank that day then the last night I got completely shitfaced. Nothing bad happened other than barfing and not remembering much. I awoke with a terrible hangover and the clear understanding that I could not moderate. I went sober again, I had the most awful depression that whole week, worse than anything I had ever experienced. My feet had this incredible burning sensation and I felt like shit. Slowly, each day I healed. The physical symptoms went away as did the self loathing and disgust. Here I am a year later and while I still have a ways to go for self improvement, I am determined not to drink again. I did not do any program and I am surrounded by people who drink still. Here are some of my learnings and tips:

* This sub and the IAmSober app were immensely helpful. Thanks to all I have received help from just by reading your stories.
* Don't sweat the whole being sober for rest of your life, just worry about 1 day at a time.
* Throw your energy and time now that you aren't drinking into something else. For me it has been physical fitness. I have always been into working out but now I am consistent and go HAM which I never did while drinking.
* anhedonia is real (never knew it was a word till going sober), struggles and challenges are real, just keep going. Hell, right now while celebrating 1 year I am going through a harder time then just a few months ago. Can't say ""just keep going"" enough.
* Everyone around me drinks, most dont even notice Im not, I have my mocktails and na beer.
* If ever contemplating drinking, think back to your most miserable experience. If that's not enough then just read this sub fllled with terrible stories of those who thought they could moderate but can't.
* It's never too late to do this.
* You need to have that aha or eureka moment where you realize you need to do this for yourself. You can't do it for anyone else's sake, at least I couldn't.
* You will likely see some immediate improvements after a few month, there's also a chance you will see none. This is a long haul, you can't put poison into your body for decades and expect everything to be better in a short period of time. I'm a year in and I feel like more healing time is needed.
* It's worth it. Keep going, I have a ways to still go but I am noticeably healthier, present and much more calm. My family doesn't talk much about it but I can tell they are proud of me. I never have to wake up feeling like shit or wondering what I did or said. People can depend on me for a ride no matter the time. I have goals that I now feel are attainable and I have increased confidence and hopefulness.

I can barely concentrate to even post this. The only deep dive I’ve done with myself that lead to this has been starting initially, the one bottle a night was from a mixture of combating an eating disorder- I couldn’t eat* without the wine to lower my fear of weight gain, anxiety, a high stress job (I’m a junior attorney) and overall I guess really just it all comes back to anxiety and life’s stressors. Never day drink, barely socially drank at restaurants (which given my field I’m invited to at least 1-2x a week) just always the same routine with me. Same position on my couch, same wine, same time of the night. I never done heroin but from what I’ve heard when you first try it, the euphoria and silence I got the second I pop that cork.. no feeling like it. Then two bottles came from building a tolerance- fast. 

I went “dry” because I was waking up (to go on with a fully functional day for the most part) just sick. Burning, shaking (even worse anxiety than I had initially), triple checking my phone if I said anything inhibited to someone (happened many times but doesn’t count when I just don’t read it or delete it) and it’s been controlling my life. I don’t know what to do. I think I need some medication or support but don’t know where to start I can’t do this on my own. I’m very close to running to the liquor store. My klonopin (anxiety medication) which I’ve been on for years isn’t working, I tried weed- every strand, dose, method you could think- definitely didn’t work, made me feel way too in my head, which is the last thing I want- and the “munchies” part triggered even worse the eating insecurity thing. Not even attempting it anymore. I truly don’t know how I can do this.

1jem21b,stopdrinking,2025-03-19 01:45:22,Quitting made me realize…,"It sounds counterintuitive, but quitting actually made me realize there’s a serious problem here. 

Quite honestly I decided to “take a sustained break” to work off the 20 pounds I’ve gained over the last couple of years, ever since my glass of wine a night habit snowballed into a bottle of wine a night habit. 

I naively thought wow with a few weeks completely AF I bet my skin will be glowing and I will be shedding weight like crazy and killing it at work. 

Wow was I wrong. I sit here tonight, reflecting on how lucky I’ve been to escape any serious life damage from my drinking escapades, which have been the S.O.P. in my life pretty much since like 18 (35F now). I’m freaking exhausted. I’m doing the bare minimum at work, laying around like a complete bum in the evenings, anhedonia, kinda depressed but more just numb. And my face is broken out like an actual teenager. Actually worse than when I was a teenager. What’s up with that? 

I guess I didn’t realize my habits were as truly problematic as they are. Our society cloaks A BENDER in socially smiled upon phrases like “brunch culture”, “the foodie scene”, shit, even commonly the guise of “professional networking”. 

I’ve done so much reading over the last three weeks, I’ve read every post on this thread, I’ve researched what happens to the body when you quit, I’ve read medical threads on here from nurses/doctors talking about the rise in young patients with liver disease. It’s sad, and it’s really really scary. I’ve seen both of my parents struggle with AUD, why the hell did I think it would possibly be any different for me? Because I wear a sundress when I do it? Wtf. 

I thought I was taking a break to lose weight but wow the veil has been lifted. Will give myself the first 30 days to laze around and process these thoughts, then I’m getting out there. I want to find a community and likeminded people and create a completely different freaking reality for myself.

I don’t really know what the point of this post is, I guess I’m just feeling grateful tonight for the opportunity to make these realizations before any more damage is done. This group really makes that possible. This is my stream of consciousness at 23 days, 2 hours, and 45 minutes of sobriety.

1j473af,stopdrinking,2025-03-05 16:30:14,My boyfriend gave up on me.,"I have been a high functioning alcoholic for 3 years. Drinking in the evenings and on the weekends. We began dating in September and I fell so hard for him… He has strong boundaries and has always told himself he wouldn’t date someone with an addiction but fell for me before he realized I did (and before I came to terms with the fact that I AM an alcoholic). December 23rd I got blackout and caused a problem. He said he wanted to leave me then but loved me too much. February 1st he came to my place and found a bottle of tequila I had hidden, from myself, because I was trying to do better, and almost broke up with me that day. I didn’t tell him I had drank the night before because I was ashamed. I had planned on telling him when I saw him the next night as I didn’t want to tell him over the phone… but he found it before I had a chance.
That was my last day of binging. We had a couple of drinks for dinners and casually but I didn’t binge for 26 days… which is HUGE for me. But, we went out with friends last Friday evening and I had 5 drinks and a shot and I accidentally embarrassed him… and that was it. He broke up with me that night on the way home. I am beyond devastated… I love him so much and I was doing SO good. I was putting so much effort into my sobriety and into OUR relationship because I would do anything for him…. But he gave up on me. I feel like I’m dying inside. I put so much effort to be better for myself and for us and I failed us, I failed him. He says he still loves me but he can’t deal with my setbacks and doesn’t want to be with an alcoholic… 
Why do I have to have this disease? Why did I ever begin it? Why couldn’t I have stopped immediately and never picked it back up? All I want is him and the future I saw for us. 
I am beginning therapy on April 7th with an addictions counselor. I am so ANGRY at alcohol, I hate it with everything in me right now. I can’t let alcohol ruin the good things in my life any longer.

1j6g4fs,stopdrinking,2025-03-08 12:27:53,I was sober for two years and decided to drink again…,"Hi everyone, how are you all doing today?

I’m what some people would call a *Problem Drinker*. 6 beers a night, sometimes more. I still manage to always get my daily chores completed. I never day drink.

In 2022, on New Year’s Eve - I decided that would be my last drink and that 2023 would be the start of new things for me. And I managed just over two years of sobriety. I was like a different person by year two. I was calmer, I enjoyed doing normal things again and didn’t even think about drink apart from the very rare occasion. Friends and family were so proud of me.

In January of this year, I received some news which I didn’t expect. A few hours later, I’m drinking again. It was a miserable experience. Sure, it numbed me at the time. But the aftermath was just horrible.

We’re now in March and I’ve tried quitting a few times, with no success. And I want to list the negative things about my experience over the last few months:

- Spent ridiculous amounts of money on beer and rum using Uber services. I was getting the same driver bringing it to me on a few occasions which was embarrassing.

- Argued with people. Had no patience with my kid. Have been snappy, tired, depressed and emotional on most days.

- Zero energy. I would work out every day before starting on the alcohol again. I just don’t work out when I’ve been on the poison the night before.

- Spent a fortune on stuff I don’t really need whilst drunk and not even realised until the morning after.

- The worst part: no-one, and I mean NO-ONE knows that I’ve been drinking again. This in itself has been incredibly stressful. My recycling bags were taken yesterday and the amount of empty bottles and cans was eye opening. There isn’t one person on my street that ever has this amount of empties in their bags, which speaks volumes. I even cancelled on my mother visiting because I didn’t want her to see the bags full of shame.

There’s a million other reasons why the last few months have sucked and it’s mainly due to one aspect of my life: alcohol. It brings nothing but problems for me. I’m a person who is diagnosed with depression and I take anti depressants for it. My doctor said years ago “Don’t drink with Prozac, you might as well just throw the pills in the bin”. That has always stuck with me and it’s so true.

So, here we go again. Let’s try sobriety again, one day at a time. I’m actually in a surprisingly good mood. I don’t have the stress of using the Uber app to order alcohol today, and bulking up the basket with food so it doesn’t look like I’m an alcoholic. I don’t have the worry of my mother or a friend swinging by for a coffee and finding me drinking.

I can use the experience of my recent two years of sobriety. And if I approach this with the same mindset as before, I should be just fine. I just need to remember: alcohol is a poison. There are zero benefits. None. Drinking for me is a futile exercise, it only ends in pain.

I guess the point of this post is - even after two years of sobriety, I realised that I simply can’t just have one or two beers. It’s always 6-7 beers, then bad food, then the shame. And then I’ll do the same the next evening, and the next.

My last drink was at 23:42 on Friday March 7th 2025.

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.

Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!

---

**This pledge is a statement of intent.** Today we don't set out *trying* not to drink, we make a conscious decision *not to drink*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn't:** A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

I wish everyone a beautiful and happy day. I wanted to say thank you for your comments if I didn’t reply to you. This is Monday, today’s post is for someone currently struggling or can relate with struggling with dependency in their past. 

I used to struggle with alcohol and from reading many posts I believe many others have had or have the same problem otherwise we wouldn’t be here. I don’t claim to have all answers with sobriety, just suggestions or tools to use at one’s own disposal if one decides.

One thing I had to do when quitting was recognizing the voice in my head. It would say like clockwork coming home from work, “stop by the gas station, pick up some alcohol, you had a hard day you deserve it. You’ll feel better.” I had to listen to myself, me not that voice, why do I need alcohol? I never had alcohol as a child, I never needed it. 

Another thing were my TRIGGERS. I personally drank at home, yes I went out and drank, but usually at home it’s much cheaper and I don’t have to drive. I’d be sitting at home doing nothing thinking wow this is boring! The gas station is right down the street. I could walk there if I had to. I had to combat my triggers with things to do. I can work freely when I want so I’d go and work and get out of the house. I’d also learn that as I quit alcohol I noticed certain other things I’d get addicted to. 

I was already addicted to caffeine, I sat down and searched my past through my thoughts, I was addicted to weed at one point and conquered it, video games, working out. I noticed I went from smoking a cigar from once every 2 months to 5 a week! Cut that back right away. I noticed I have good and bad addictions, but I can use this to my advantage. I started baking things like cookies and let me tell you I was awful at it at first. Then, through time as an alcoholic is great at drinking, I became really good at baking. So good one day I got down and depressed, instead of thinking of alcohol my first thought was I’m going to go home and bake cookies. I was proud of myself. 

Another thing I did through my journey was looking at alcohol with a different perception. I needed this substance. NEED? Huh? Like air to breathe? I went to wanting it and then just taking all the meaning out of alcohol it’s just a liquid that fills its container, I can give it more power if I allow my mind, but why? It’s poison that’s destroying my life. 


Recap: 

Recognizing the voice in my head, understanding triggers, awareness is a powerful tool, find other positive addictions, have a different perception of alcohol and of life.

I’ve come to a realization that I’m a deeply unhappy and depressed person. This is in part a natural propensity to be this way from birth and in part because of life circumstances that have brought me to feel shame, guilt and unworthiness.


I decided I wanted to stop drinking for the entirety of 2025 and I haven’t drank since Dec 31st which in the grand scheme of things I realize isn’t very long. But I would think it’s enough time for it to leave my system and for my brain to be more capable of experiencing good emotions.

I stopped because I felt deeply unhappy, anxious, sad and guilty about myself and my life. I’m completely burnt out.

I continue to feel just as sad, guilty and unhappy about myself. I cry almost everyday and I have just had many thoughts and desires that I’ll die sometime soon. I’m 32f.

I’ll continue my journey and maybe I’ll be surprised but sometimes I think I’m just an unhappy person and that will be true whiter alcohol is in my life or not.

1j6oj9h,stopdrinking,2025-03-08 19:15:03,Returned to my old workplace to find everyone drinking themselves into oblivion,"Now let me preface this by saying I struggle. I struggle a lot and I struggle often. Less than a month ago I had a miscarriage and immediately dove off the deep end right into a bottle. Now 6 months ago I left my favorite place of employment because my hours were cut so dramatically. About a month ago they called me and asked if I'd be willing to come back part time. I was overjoyed. I miss them all so much and I enjoyed the job a lot. And having gone through one of the most traumatic experiences of my life it was great news to hear they wanted me back. 

Now it's important to note that I work in a distillery. A distillery that has a restaurant. I work in the kitchen. After cleanup last Sunday my sous chef convinced me to take two shots with him. ""Fuck it"" I thought. I'm excited to be back and I missed these people. Why not. 

That night I wound up buying a 12 pack on the way home, drinking all of it, and staying up till 7:00 in the morning. I didn't regain consciousness until around noon. That's when I realized that I didn't get my kid to school, he hadn't had breakfast yet, and he was safe in his room playing his Xbox. I was down hard for 3 days. One night of drinking fucked up 3 days of my life.

Yesterday was my first workday of the week. I pulled my boss aside and I told him very directly that I needed to draw a boundary. Do not ask me if I want or offer me alcohol. I have a serious problem, I am on a lot of medication for psychiatric illness, and it makes me a worse person. I'm really bad at saying no and it would mean a lot to me if he refrained from offering me alcohol. 

I watched him take at least four shots during service. We had a full board and he paused to go take a shot out of a ramekin. Then after service and during clean up I watched him throw back a few more. I watched the way he behaved and the way he spoke. This is not the man that I left here six months ago. It hurts me so much to see him like this. This boss who I became good friends with, looked up to, and respected. Now....I'm just so incredibly worried for him. He has a 6 kids and one works there with us. I'm scared for her too. It's truly hurting me to see this.

I plan to approach him about everything I'm witnessing. But it's too soon yet. Maybe this Sunday.

But honestly it was like looking in a mirror. It scared me for myself as well. I don't want to be like that. I only have one kid but I need to be there for him. And every time I do exactly what he's doing right now I wind up in bed for 3 days. The costs are too huge.

Normally after service and clean up I would hang around for a little while to talk with everyone. About work and how we can improve. But also a personal lives. I wanted to do that. But after seeing my boss like that I knew I had to leave if I wanted to not drink. He had already offered me wine once that evening even after the conversation we had. I NEEDED TO LEAVE. 

The entire way home was hard. I was very aware of every single turn I could make that I knew would lead to somewhere I could buy beer. I came home, ate a bunch of junk food, and went to bed until 1pm the next day. *note- my son is away with his Dad for the weekend*

But I'm sober. I did it. I avoided giving in to what I honestly feel is my biggest trigger. That place, those people I love, and the camaraderie we share. And the overabundance of alcohol considering it's a distillery. 

I'm going to keep going back and doing my job. For them. The entire staff is so disheartened and depressed. I hate seeing them like this. They need me sober too. I want to lighten the load and I can't do that if I'm drinking.

1j0si4o,stopdrinking,2025-03-01 05:43:43,"The Daily Check-In for Saturday March 1st: Just for today, I am NOT drinking!","*We may be anonymous strangers on the internet, but we have one thing in common. We may be a world apart, but we're here together!*

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.

Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!

---

**This pledge is a statement of intent.** Today we don't set out *trying* not to drink, we make a conscious decision *not to drink*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn't:** A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

Welcome to March, everyone

New month, new you? Today could be the last day that you ever have to feel hungover, anxious, sick and overall terrible. Whether you are on day 1 or day 1000, I invite you to check in and gather/offer support within the amazing group here. To anyone struggling right now, don't. stop. trying.

I don't know if the phrase March comes in like a lion and out like a lamb is a cross cultural phrase. But for anyone who's March started like a lion, I hope it ends like a lamb for you. 

I could probably continue hosting for weeks straight because this has given me time to reflect more on my sobriety journey and I've enjoyed sharing some of it this week. But... it's also probably best that I get back to listening more and talking less. 

Quick shoutout to the 'Recent Posts In Need of Attention' button on this subreddit. It's in the About section of the subreddit. Good place to find posts that could use some extra attention (as well as sorting by new posts).

Thanks everyone for checking in with me this week, all of the responses have been meaningful to me. 

I will not drink with you all today.

1jkmqpl,stopdrinking,2025-03-26 21:07:40,Thought I could do it. Shame.,"
I had 70 days under my belt and I was getting restless. I wasn't drinking because of a medication I was taking but I haven't been taking it for over a week. So of course in my mind that means I can drink again. I didn't have a healthy relationship with alcohol even before the medication and last night I thought I could do it: drink responsibly. 

I opened a bottle of red wine and drank a couple glasses while I cooked and baked. It was nice. But then I had a 3rd and 4th glass. Then I snuck a brandy shooter in some mango juice while my boyfriend was in the living room. Then I thought ""what the hell a glass out of another bottle will be fine."" I opened a new bottle and while I did only have 1 glass everything was not fine.

 I barely remember going to bed and barely remember sex with my boyfriend. I spent the first hour and a half of bedtime out in the living room moaning because my spins were so out of control. I threw up at least 4 times and finally fell asleep on the couch until 3am with the light on. I couldn't stomach having the light off because of the awful spins. I woke up at 3 and slinked back to meet my boyfriend in bed. 

Today I've been so anxious, nauseous,  and just downright ashamed of myself. My hand even smeeled like vomit when I woke up. It's disgusting and pathetic. I truly thought it would be okay this time. Clearly not. 
So today I start over. IWNDWYT or ever again.

Edit: I want to thank everyone for the kind and encouraging words.  It changed my entire perspective and turned my day around. What a beautiful community.

1jk5lt2,stopdrinking,2025-03-26 06:40:39,Sixty Days: Alcohol Wasn't The Only Problem,"Well, here I am at sixty days. My longest stretch of sobriety in 8 years. You'd think it would feel triumphant and the music would swell, but that doesn't seem to be the case. In fact, up until a couple of days ago, I was more depressed than I've been in a very long time.

These last two months have forced me to dig deep and reflect on a lot of uncomfortable truths. What I've found out is that while alcohol was certainly *a* problem, it was not *the* problem.

I won't go into a huge existential manifesto here (what a total bummer would that be?) but I do want to share a little of what I've been going through.

Many people say the first two weeks are the hardest, but that wasn't the case for me. Back then, my shame was so heavy I couldn't even *imagine* wanting to drink again. As time went on, though, the shame faded and I had to confront why I was drinking in the first place.

I often feel detached from the world around me, like I'm feeling it through thick surgical gloves. Last week, there were a couple days where I couldn't find the will to get out of bed.

Dealing with those feelings instead of drinking them made me understand why I drank. This sucks! How great would it be to crack a can and make those problems disappear? Well, I hid inside those cans for years, but when I crawled out the problems were still there waiting for me, bigger and badder than ever.

This past weekend, I spent a lot of time journaling and reflecting on these root problems. Not telling myself I'm a bitch for feeling the way I feel, not clamping them down, and not drowning them in alcohol. For the first time in I don't know how long, I feel light. Like I might be redeemable after all.

There's a lot of work to be done. It's a little intimidating. But I'm not afraid of hard work.

I put this out there because so much of what we see are the quick benefits, but those don't come to all of us. I'm still waiting on the sobriety fairy to bring me the weight loss and nice skin I ordered a couple months ago. A lot of recovery, maybe most of recovery, is gritting your teeth and holding onto hope when the entire thing seems pointless. If you're someone who is fighting for yourself right now, hold on. Better days are coming.

1j0golg,stopdrinking,2025-02-28 19:56:07,"They tried to make me go to rehab and I said yes, yes yes","About 3 weeks ago my wife secretly connected with my parents about my destructive drinking (26er every night, blacking out, etc.) I was pissed off due to the shame and embarrassment. 

After a few days go by I realize that this has been a dark and heavy secret of mine for almost 20 years and maybe it’s time my closest family knows. I proceed to tell my family, as well as her parents. Nobody expected this at all as I’m an addict and a pro at this point for hiding my addiction. 

The weight of letting my/her family know released about ten pounds off my chest, while I finally admit I need help and that I can’t do this alone. 

My wife’s beautiful parents then offer to pay for in person rehab (I can’t believe people in my life love me this much because I yet to love my self). 

I’m going to rehab starting next Thursday for about 40 days.

1jgit3w,stopdrinking,2025-03-21 14:59:31,I made a complete fool out of myself last night,"Hey everyone.

First of all let me just say I stopped drinking around a week ago so I could stop feeling like shit all the time. Then yesterday comes around and I get asked to go to dinner with a friend and I say yes thinking I either won’t drink or just stick to a couple beers. I can’t ever do that so of course I ended having around 6-7 drinks which is not okay. I then proceeded to drive home which I don’t remember at all besides a few key details. And this is the worst thing I think I have ever done. 

First embarrassing thing- at the last bar which was basically empty I walked to the other side of the bar to continue a conversation with the bartender and I thought I was being friendly but my friend told me that was weird and I was being a predator. But I wasn’t trying to hit on her so I didn’t understand at the time but of course now I do. Looking back I’m so embarrassed and disgusted. I turn into a complete different person when I drink and I hate it.

I stopped vaping a year ago and stopped at a vape shop while drunk. I stopped at this vape shop after fully pissing my pants and just wrapped a sweat shirt around me. I gave the guy my card and he told me it was wet and I was like “idk why.” Then while I’m in the vape shop I go to pick something up and fall on my hands and knees and could not get up. My balance was awful. The guy kept asking me if I was okay and I kept saying yes and left very quickly and drove home. Not only was the guy in there but two other people were in there watching me on the ground covered in my own piss and I gave him my card which was also covered in pissed. I am so beyond anxious and embarrassed right now because I hope I never see those people from last night again. Granted I probably wouldn’t even know if I saw them again bc I can’t remember their faces. But they’ll certainly remember me. Has anyone ever completely embarrassed themselves like this? I don’t even know what to do right now I can’t even focus on work and I’ve been “logged on” for 2 hours at this point. 

I’m done doing this. I’m 23 and have a bright future ahead of me if this stuff can stop. IWNDWYT. I’m so done.

1jcujqa,stopdrinking,2025-03-16 20:12:48,I did it! I joined the comma club :D,"Today is day 1,000 alcohol free for me, it’s genuinely an accomplishment I didn’t think I would see. I set out June 20 2022 to give myself at least a year off to recalibrate. Excessive alcohol intake made me a shell of a person, I had sacrificed so much of myself that I valued to binge drink. I tried and failed countless times to not drink, I could barely string together days, hours sometimes. 

I spent the first year intentionally rediscovering who I was after giving up drinking, I felt genuine random happiness at day 81, I got sober hobbies, focused on improving my mental health and built a sober support network. I found healthy ways to decompress, I got physically strong, and I felt relief when the person in the mirror started to resemble a person I wanted to be again. Someone’s post said it on here, and I resonate with the sentiment I “built a life incompatible with drinking.” 

I still get itchy here and there for a drink, but I keep in mind “no matter how far you travel down the road, you’re still the same distance from the ditch.” I don’t want to invite something back into my life that took away so much pleasure in living.

1jmaa0u,stopdrinking,2025-03-29 00:40:17,I hit day 600. No one to share it with other than you all. Thank you for everything. And I also covet some advice,"Hi my people. I just need to share this with some folks who can appreciate it. While I am indeed proud (to some degree, although it doesn’t mitigate the years of accumulated shame.. I know, walked 10 miles in, you have 10 miles to walk back out) it is also disheartening that I can’t even share it with my wife. 

Saying that to say I’m not posting for affirmation as I am for some advice from others who have been in my position.

The position: I (thankfully) do not currently have struggles or urges to drink. But, alcohol still plays an active role in my life because my wife is an alcoholic. Not to the point where I was (eye opener, drinking before work and throughout the day, highly functional and knew my limits which works perfectly well until it doesn’t. you know the drill). 

But she works blocks of days at a time. So when that third day is up, or whatever, she starts drinking immediately and is either inebriated or asleep basically the entire time not working. 

We have had talks about it (we have generally good communication) but it just continues. She’ll make very vague statements about wanting to quit, sometimes when sober-ish, but nothing really changes. Not even request to make some type of effort, seek help, read any of the books. 

Any insights or advice from folks who have been on similar situations would be helpful. I don’t want to leave her. I love her more than anything in this world and beyond. I want us to start a family, but I have told her that I won’t even consider having a child until she is sober and I don’t feel comfortable even starting to try until she is ~a year sober. Biological time is ticking. 

Aside from that I have expressed how much anxiety it causes me and how tough it is to be in active recovery and her be drunk with regularity and leave booze around the house etc.

1jl3e5n,stopdrinking,2025-03-27 13:02:21,Doc told me I will die if I keep drinking.,"So I'm about a month sober now. Spent eight days in the hospital where they drained almost 3 liters of fluid from my abdomen. Had ascites but no infection luckily. Red and white blood cells it off wack. Bilirubin at around 20%. I'm still jaundiced and legs and feet are constantly swollen. 

I was diagnosed with alcohol hepatitis and when my doc told me I will die that's all it took me to sober up. It was like a switch was turned on and like magic my cravings for alcohol were gone. 

For backstory since about 2013 I would drink a fifth of whiskey a day. Friday and Saturday would be an entire handle.  A few years ago I switched to 5 white claw surges tall boys a day. It just became a daily habit like making dinner or taking a shit. I wasn't depressed(at least according to my therapist) I was just bored because I had a job where I was constantly on the road and had a lot of alone time. 

Now I'm just waiting until next week to see my GP and GE docs to see where I go next. There is possibility I may have to get on the transplant list but luckily University of Florida has an excellent kidney and liver hospital so I'll be in good hands if it comes to it. 

I don't really have anything profound to say but if I can do it then you can too. You got this. Don't wait until it gets too far gone.

1jens0x,stopdrinking,2025-03-19 03:16:23,Holy shit. 100 days sober.,"I can't believe I'm even typing this out, but I hit the magic 3 digit mark a few days ago! 

Little background: Sunday, December 1st I woke up out of a dead sleep and my first thought was ""I'm done with this shit."" I've tried a few times to quit drinking in the past but didn't even really half ass those attempts. More like quarter or eighth assed them. I'm not sure why it was different this time, but by that Wednesday I was in detox and by the following Thursday I was in rehab and stayed for 30 days. Best decision I've ever made by far.

There are a lot of posts like these and a whole bunch of awesome people have shared their insights so I'll share some of mine.

The good:

* SLEEP! Oh my god the sleep. I went from 4-5 hours of fitful, terrible, anxiety ridden sleep to sleeping between 7-8 hours a night. 

* Walking anxiety levels are nearly zero. I mean, I still get anxious about things but there's not that ever present sense of doom and dread 24/7.

* Appetite and health are way, way better. My appetite came back about 2.5 weeks after I stopped drinking. I eat healthy and actually get hungry for good food vs drinking 2000 calories in beer before noon. I exercise at least 5 days a week, am gaining muscle and am way less bloated looking. My skin has taken an incredible turn for the better too. 

* Work performance is through the roof. I was always pretty high functioning and got great reviews, promotions and everything, but I no longer feel that imposter dread that someone is eventually going to find out I'm in a hurry to get out of a meeting so I can go buy more beer.

* I'm just _happy_. I don't know how else to describe it. I'm past the rose colored glasses phase and I'm genuinely happy and content. I've started a few new hobbies, like learning to play piano and taking some pottery / blacksmithing classes that I've always wanted to do but was drunk all the time and never did. 

The not good:

* I'm on vacation right now and I wish I could sit and have a beer or two with my friends and family at a beach bar. I know I can't and I don't want to because life is so much better, but I do want to, you know?

* I don't do a lot of things I genuinely enjoyed before, like checking out new breweries, finding a great happy hour patio and shooting the shit with friends, having a green beer on St. Patricks day, etc.

* I am terrified that my dating life is basically over for who knows how long. I know this isn't entirely true but the only dating I know how to do has always started with meeting someone on an app, grabbing a drink and seeing where things go from there. 

* My social life is kinda meh. I used to have the same routine of finishing work, going to the bar, drinking with my friends, rinse, repeat. Now it's pointless to go sit and pay money for soda or an N/A while people get drunk so relationships have kinda fallen off. 

There are a lot more things in both columns but I wanted to share what has been the most obvious. Even with the ""bad"", I wouldn't trade this for anything in the world. Most of those things are simply due to the fact that I need to learn how to live my life not on a barstool, which is all I've known most of my adult life.

1j6on07,stopdrinking,2025-03-08 19:19:48,I’m beginning to think being sober has no cons 🤔,"Today I am 12 days sober. And as the title jokingly says I feel great, I’ve lost 6 pounds and I can feel my body healing. 

I have thought about grabbing a beer or two but what is the point? I KNOW that if I grab one, I’ll want 12. So I am not going to do it. How do I know this? Because I’ve done it time….and time again. This time will be different. I’ll be 25 this year, I know I need to make a change.

As conceited as it may sound I pretty much quit because I was gaining weight. 15 pounds in 2 years to be exact. I felt ugly and depressed and you know what helped that? News flash it was alcohol. Another news flash is that alcohol made it temporarily better because I was drunk and wasn’t thinking about how fat I was until the next day when I woke up and realized I was even fatter and more bloated and my face looked like a puffer fish 🤪

Now that I’ve lost some weight and can see it on myself. I’m gaining back confidence, not only from the point of view that I’d like to look good naked again but because now it’s beginning to switch from me caring so much about my outside appearance that I also feel great on the inside. 

Things I’ve noticed:
- no more gross BM (if you know you know)
- not really craving the horrendous foods I’d binge on when I was drunk af
- I wake up feeling great and alert and not horrendously hungover 
- I enjoy cooking, and EATING (bc I didn’t want to eat to ruin my buzz duh!)
- Acne is subsiding 
- I threw myself into nutrient deficiency in my addiction and my hair started falling out, it’s not falling out anymore and I hope it comes back :(
- my severe anxiety is calming
- I’m less moody (like you know when you get drunk and cry over nothing, yea you’re not supposed to do that) 


I was ill and the disease of alcoholism wanted to take me, and had a pretty good grip for a little while. 

But here I am 12 days sober of the poison. I wish I was able to kick it long ago, but here I am and to anyone that’s read this far, IWNDWYT.

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.

Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!

---

**This pledge is a statement of intent.** Today we don't set out *trying* not to drink, we make a conscious decision *not to drink*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn't:** A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

I was sitting in a bar at some point in my sobriety, I think around day 80 or so of my current sobriety streak I was in a bar/breakfast dining place. It was there that the alcohol had called out to me almost as if the scene from the movie The Shining where Jack Nicholson or Jack in the movie is sitting at an empty bar and suddenly there’s a bartender named Lloyd appears and starts talking to him and suddenly there’s a ton of alcohol in an empty bar. It reminds me of the inner voice and addiction. It was there I realized alcohol is for other people not myself at the bar. I really haven’t had a hard time this time around. My perception of alcohol has changed because I have allowed it to.

1j8nxpc,leaves,2025-03-11 10:49:12,Six months without it. Some things I'm able to do again:,"This morning I saw a YouTube comment of mine about quitting weed blow up unexpectedly, so I thought I'd come by this nice little forum to talk about a few things that quitting weed has brought into my life. I hope this inspires you.

\- Since January, I've read four physical books, start to finish. Some of them I annotated a lot of thoughts about in a notebook, because I like to research things. I can talk about what I read afterwards. The kind of thing a normal human brain should know how to do.

\- I can look at my mother in the eyes when we're together, because I have nothing to hide. The same applies to my girlfriend, or any intimate person.

\- I can actually focus on my job and enjoy it, without jumping from YT video to YT video, to random internet article about unrelated subject, to walking around the house, etc.

\- I am back learning songs on the guitar, start to finish.

\- I can meditate again. I can sit in silence and contemplate.

\- I can save money, not spend it on some stupid crap I suddenly decided I need, or impulsively eating trash.

\- I can actually think before I speak, and I am able to maintain trains of thought. Continuous, uninterrupted logical reasoning, as God intended.

\- I'm able to study new programming languages and get better at my job.

\- I actually process my emotions. I feel angry, sad, calm, happy. I observe the feelings and acknowledge them. They are no longer a complex mass of anxiety and panic, a running stream of endless thoughts. I listen to what my body has to say, unashamed. I let it flow inside me, until it goes away.

\- I can breathe much, much better (in my country weed is not legal, so we often smoke low quality, illegal crap that really gets your lungs dirty with horrible, unregulated additives put there by criminals). I unfortunately still struggle with the - occasional - cigarette, but I'm eager to stop that as well, forever.

\- I can think about yesterday and tomorrow, make plans, and recognize the incremental nature of my pursuits. Play the guitar a little everyday, study a little everyday - that's what makes you grow. It may not look like it at first, but when you do a little everyday, that is where real, unstoppable power lies. I'm still getting the hang of consistency, but I have faith it will continue. The days go by one way or the other, it's better to populate them with good effort.

\- I can feel present where I am. The short bus ride from home to college, the class, and then coming back. I'm not inside a foggy haze where places blend into each other and things lose their meaning.

\- I can remember subjects, conversations, people's names, people's faces.

\- When I bring a book somewhere, I actually read it.

There are many, many other things as well. This list is potentially infinite. Quitting was anxiogenic at first, but frankly, I don't even think about it anymore. When a friend offers me a puff when we're at the bar drinking beer, I just decline and have a glass of water. There is always a way.

I hope this has inspired you. You are free to ask me anything, here or in the DMs. Let's talk and I'll help you.

1j6m8wn,leaves,2025-03-08 17:34:01,Weed & Porn are a destructive duo…. PLEASE STAY AWAY!,"It’s one thing to do one or the other but once you get in the habit of doing both together…. You truly do not realize how bad it is until you try to quit both at the same time. 

My dopamine receptors are completely fried and I’m extremely frustrated that I have jerked/smoked myself into this chronic duo addiction but I am determined to quit.

With weed AND porn, I have quit multiple times this year with my longest being 30 days. I managed to not smoke for two years but getting laid off sent me down a very bad depression/path and ultimately back down this bad rabbit hole.

Smoking blunts & masturbating 3-4x a day is not good… this is a cry for help.

Long story short:
• Started watching porn heavily around 12 years old.
• First smoked weed at 15 years old, did not like it.
• Started smoking it heavily at 16 years old due to smoking again and getting an amazing “high”, and have been chasing that high ever since. 
• Around 19-20/ I discovered my love for backwoods/leaf and now have a nicotine addiction as well as cannabis dependency.
• Started making porn & weed a routine around that time and have been stuck in it ever since. I am 28 years old now.
• Quit for two years but the lay off brought me back.
• I know that my weed & porn combo has crippled my self esteem, brain development, and just self overall.

I am freeing myself and going into my 30s as the best version of myself. I wish I never picked the herb back up cause this second time is so much worse. I am done with “stroke & smoke” and ready for “sober & loving life”, and to have a healthy relationship with sex/people that doesn’t involve porn or weed.

Anyone else struggle with this combo? Today is Day 1 for me.

1jdooed,leaves,2025-03-17 21:41:20,Smoked After 8 Months,"As the title reads, I smoked weed after 8 months of sobriety. My experience was not what I expected or what most of you here would expect either. 

I was a heavy smoker. All day every day for 8 whole years. I hadn't been sober for 1 day in my whole adulthood, I started at 18 and quit at 26. I didn't know anything else except being stoned. I relied on it to eat, to sleep, to calm my anxiety, to cure my depression, for creativity, for a cure to loneliness, and boredom, and sadness... For everything. I hailed it as this all powerful spirit that was the soul reason I had survived. In truth I think weed did help me survive some dark times, to give credit where it's due. 

When I quit, I didn't have much faith in myself. I'd never tried to quit before, I felt horrendous when I didn't smoke, but I had this thing inside me telling me that for some reason my time with weed was up and that I needed to get sober and not be tied to weed anymore. So I did it. At first I told myself 'ill do 30 days', then it became 'okay fine I'll do 3 months' and so on. In the end I told myself If I made it to 8 months and still wanted to smoke, I was allowed to do it again. The idea of quitting forever really scared me back then. 

You all know how it goes; the first days are hell, first weeks are rough too, then you're a few months in and depression hits and you're wondering why you quit in the first place but you keep trucking and find solutions and keep growing and changing even though it's difficult. I tried MA and other programmes but felt like sitting around all day talking about weed just made me fixate on weed rather than working on my life and myself. I made friends there but stopped going and did my own thing, still following some steps and holding myself accountable but minus the cult vibes (no offense to any MA goers, it's just not my style). I study psychology and I'm really an experimental scientist at heart, I don't believe that 12 steps is for everyone and I set out to test that theory. 

Anyways I start living a totally different life. I change completely as a person. Most of the time I forget weed ever existed. People smoked it around me all the time and I'd be like 'no thank you'. I hit a lot of road blocks and have to figure out new solutions to these problems and even though it's difficult I did it. But in the back of my mind, every time something would go wrong or I would have a negative feeling or I'd experience something shitty, I'd think 'fuck, if I could smoke, this would all go away and be fixed'. So often, I had that mindset and that stopped me from actually going to find real solutions. I told myself 'well I can't smoke, so I can't fix it, gotta just be miserable' putting all the power onto weed as if it was magic. 

I was in a weirdly good place when I decided to get myself some weed to smoke for the first time once I hit 8 months. I wanted enough for one joint, but could only get 3.5g. That was an issue. So I planned and planned trying to set up these parameters to stop me from slipping back into my old ways. Ended up throwing away most of it except for what I smoked. And when I smoked....all I felt was 'you didn't need this, this does not and never did solve your problems, throw it away and keep going on the road you're carving'. It wasn't a bad experience, it was good, but it wasn't this all encompassing all fixing magical being that I'd hailed it to be. I realised that at this point..when I hit road blocks, I can't say 'oh but if I could just smoke I'd be fine' because that's not true anymore. Weed doesn't fix anything for me anymore. It doesn't fit into this life I've built and while yes I understand why I used to love it, I don't feel the same anymore. It was like an ex who you were in love with as a teenager, who you thought was the best, but they weren't good for you, so you try your best to move on, still idolising them in your mind a little, then one day you run into them and are completely underwhelmed. The illusion shattered BC you have changed and grown and see with new eyes that they weren't all that. 

That was days ago now, I'm not here to tell you that 'i can smoke in moderation! Look at me!!', no I can't. I don't want to, I enjoy what I've built and I'd never go back. It was amazing to have smoked and to then come back to sobriety and not feel like absolute shit. And that can only be that way because I smoked once within 8 months. All of that good would go away if I started smoking even semi regularly again. 

I know to most of you this will count as a relapse and you'll tell me to restart my day counter, but I've never been a big fan of counting days anyway. Im proud of my 8 months, and I'm proud that I smoked and didn't want to do it again and took all the measures to stop it happening again. My curiosity is satiated. 

Idk I hope you read this and maybe change your mindset a little. Weed is not all powerful, it is not the fixer of all problems, You are. You have the power. Shit happens, weed won't ever stop that. It'll just make you blind to it. So put in your sober hours and days and remember that where you're at is where you are meant to be, that it's a place where you hold the power. Even if it's difficult. Smoking or getting high is mid, severely mid. Have a glass of wine (if you are able to !) or sign up for a 5k. There are a billion experiences out there that are better than getting high. Tell yourself that you'll smoke as much as you want when you hit 75 if you really start itching for it. Or if you do what I did, throw away your shit, come back to sobriety, know that it is better than being stuck in that weird haze even when times are tough.

1jbk4md,leaves,2025-03-15 01:36:12,The biggest scam ever,"For a long time, I believed the whole “weed isn’t addictive” narrative. I told myself that since I never experienced withdrawals the way an alcoholic or hard drug user might, I wasn’t actually dependent. But the more I reflect, the more I realize I was lying to myself.

Weed hooked me in a way that was sneaky. There was no brutal hangover, no violent consequences—just an easy, feel-good escape. It made mundane things fun, made boredom vanish, and before I knew it, I wasn’t just smoking occasionally; I was planning my highs around activities I “couldn’t” do sober.

At first, it seemed harmless. But then I noticed a pattern—I’d tell myself I’d take a break, only to find an excuse to light up again. “Might as well finish what I have.” “I had a long day.” “It’s just another half a gummy.” And over time, the anticipation of getting high became a high itself. I didn’t even need to smoke yet—just knowing I was about to was enough to trigger that dopamine rush. That was the moment I realized weed isn’t that innocent of a vice.

Quitting was eye-opening. Not because of the physical withdrawals, but because of how much my brain craved it. This is when the “mental addiction” narrative about weed really hit close to home. The cycle wasn’t easy to break, and that’s when it hit me—if something makes you chase it, if it becomes part of your routine to the point where the thought of stopping feels uncomfortable, isn’t that addiction? Is that not the hallmark of a highly addictive substance?

I used to laugh at the idea that weed could be addictive. Now, after experiencing it firsthand, I see it differently. It doesn’t have to wreck your life to have a hold on you. It just has to keep you coming back. So yeah, in my opinion the whole “weed isn’t addictive” trope is the biggest scam ever.

1j3pl1g,leaves,2025-03-04 23:59:27,"1 month no weed, and life is bright!!!","I quit smoking weed a month ago. The difference is crazy and I'm so grateful I stopped. 

For a while now- I've used weed to cope with loneliness and depression. To kill the time, stop being bored, to stop anxious thoughts, to enable my food binging habits. But every morning I would wake up feeling fuzzy. Feeling shameful for the dumb things I had said the night before, for doing nothing all day. I would mainly smoke at night, but during the days too sometimes- and all I would do was watch youtube and eat. No self control. For some people weed helps them be productive- not me. I will sit on my ass or sleep. I didn't dream. I couldn't make art or write. Everything in my head was quiet- for a price.

Now- now,

My lungs can open all the way now! I'm running again. The first couple nights trying to sleep without it made me anxious but I lacked trust in my body that it couldn't sleep sans weed- yes, it can. I dream now and remember them. My head is clear, I feel sharp, and creative. I'm actually less anxious than I was smoking, and I'm able to process what's happening better. 

It's like smoking weed is picking at a scab that keeps welling with blood because you're perpetually reopening the wound. Yeah, it sucks to leave the scab on- but being sober, sit with the discomfort and it will heal, because you let it.

I can cry again. I missed that. My therapist says not being able to cry is an emotional handicap. The point is, I can live live without substances, and I'm proud of myself for taking control of my life again- even if it's painful. Yes, life is boring now. But I started crocheting, I've picked back up the guitar, and I'm reading. And feeling lonely makes me talk to people now and sign up for clubs instead to make new friends. I still have my issues, my binging tendencies- I'm not fixed, but at least I'm trying to get better.

All we can do with this short life we have is to experience and enjoy it, and I'm done wasting my life not being able to do either. I know this was long, but I really wanted to share my experience!

1j7gszv,leaves,2025-03-09 20:27:32,I'm not going to choose borderline psychosis over boredom anymore,"I started using weed 10 yrs ago because I knew I 'needed *something*' that wasn't as damaging to my body as other drugs/alcohol. It was never meant for me, despite my continual daily use (except for two 5-month-long breaks.)
     I say this because I have gotten tightness in my chest every single time I've used it.  My fear of boredom has driven me into daily anxiety! The pros of use include making cleaning, makeup & weight training passionate endeavors.

But, I must be one whose dormant mental illnesses are exploited by long term weed use. Majority of the time I feel immediately depressed & demented . 
It's no longer the romantic mindset I've defended it as. I refuse to continue choosing writhing melancholy over fear of boredom. Sobriety looks so much cooler & cuter to me now. I will be that person who is energetic & sober. I'm making the choice to maintain a can-do mindset & not look back. 
I look forward to the natural energy & earned joy that will come from sobriety. 
I know that my 2 relapses after 5 months of sobriety in the past came from an urge to feel interest for life. Boredom sucks - & I will have to prepare myself to get through it .

After exclusively using a dry herb vaporizer, I felt little rolling a little joint. These last few nights I’ve been taking two or one hits after the kids go to bed. Last night I took three and they took me for a ride.

These last few years I’ve had to deal with the anxiety of having my heart racing after smoking, and I got pretty good at grounding myself by doing deep breath until it went away. Always feared it could lead to a medical emergency.

Well, last night it got up to 162 bpm, heart racing for more than an hour. Started trembling and my wife had to call an ambulance. They took me to the hospital, did an ECG and fortunately everything was fine.

All the times before, I’ve stopped smoking due to a heart racing scare, and fortunately it comes easy for me. I just stop. Then time goes by, I get the feeling of missing being high sometimes, then I take it again, and so it goes.

Yet, never before it had escalated to this point. Ever.

So yeah, this is it for me. It’s over.

Just needed to vent about this. Thank you.

TL;DR: heart racing scares after smoking, last night escalated like never before, ambulance involved. Quitting for good.

1jb8i0i,leaves,2025-03-14 16:50:37,TWO WEEKS CLEAN. I NEVER THOUGHT THIS WAS POSSIBLE.,"For 3-5 years, I was stuck in the same miserable loop ripping carts every day, chasing that first high that never came back. $70 a week, sometimes more. Every hit was just trying to feel normal, but instead, I felt lifeless. No motivation, no confidence, no direction just a foggy, numb existence on autopilot.

But here I am, two weeks clean. And holy sh*t, I feel alive again.

-Mental clarity? Unreal. My brain actually works again. I remember things better, conversations flow naturally, and I don’t feel like I’m lagging behind reality anymore.

-Energy levels? Through the roof. No more waking up feeling like I got hit by a bus. No more mid-day crashes. I actually want to do things instead of sitting around scrolling on my phone.

-Confidence? Night and day. I don’t feel awkward or anxious in social situations anymore. I’m present. I make eye contact. I carry myself differently. People notice.

-Food? Bro, I forgot food could taste this good. Everything is so much richer, flavors actually hit, and I’m enjoying eating again instead of just mindlessly snacking.

-Sleep? Deep, refreshing, and natural. I’m waking up actually rested, not groggy and miserable like I used to. No more tossing
 and turning all night.

-Money? Stacking up fast. Instead of blowing $70+ a week, I’ve been saving and actually treating myself to things I want—not just another cart to feed the cycle.

-Dating life? After two years of avoiding real social interaction, I went on a first date. And I’ll just say… let’s just say I got lucky. But beyond that, I actually felt comfortable in my own skin for the first time in forever.

-Workouts? I’m taking my training to a whole new level. The gym has become my main thing, and now that I’m not constantly drained from carts, I feel stronger, sharper, and more focused than ever. Every session, I’m pushing harder, lifting heavier, and feeling my body actually respond. The difference is unreal—I’m going HAM and loving every second of it.

I never thought quitting would actually make life better, but it’s so much better than I ever imagined. I was scared I’d feel bored or empty without weed, but instead, I feel free.

If you’re stuck in the cycle, this is your sign! there’s a way out, and it’s worth it.

1jirzz6,leaves,2025-03-24 14:30:25,"I though smoking again would be fun, it really wasn't","I went a little over two months without smoking weed this year and felt amazing. Grocery shopping, meal prepping, and everyday tasks weren’t overwhelming. My focus was sharp, my energy was high, and I was getting so much done at work. Social anxiety was gone. I could talk to anyone with complete confidence. I felt proud of myself. My goals felt real, and I was actually working toward them. Even the little things like watching my favorite shows, drinking a sparkling water, or cooking with friends made me happy.  

But at some point, I started taking it all for granted. No matter what I accomplished at work, in the gym, or in my personal life, nothing felt exciting or like something to be proud of. So after weeks of thinking about it, I made a conscious decision to smoke again. One hit after work on a Thursday. Then another a few days later. Then another. Then another. I told myself I’d keep up my routines and healthy habits.  

That was almost two weeks ago. Here’s what I’ve learned.  

The pros: Social media videos were way funnier. A movie I saw in theaters felt super intense in a cool way. That’s about it.  

The cons: Everything else.  

I woke up the next day still feeling high and had to push through work feeling completely off. A full 24 hours after taking *one* hit from a weed pen I still felt weird in meetings. I got a call from my mom and felt uncomfortable for no reason. My brain was overthinking everything. My friendships, my relationship, my place in life.  

Social anxiety hit hard. At the office, I started changing my walking path to avoid people. I couldn’t look friends in the eye. I canceled two social plans because I got too high and the thought of seeing people, driving, or even leaving the house felt like too much. When I went on walks in my neighborhood, I felt like my neighbors were staring out their windows watching me. It was weird.  

At work, I didn’t care about anything. My boss, who usually hates me, told me I was doing a great job recently, and I know that wouldn’t be the case if I kept this up. Grocery shopping and cooking felt overwhelming again. My energy was gone. I felt moody, groggy, antisocial, lazy, and out of sync with myself.  

On top of that, my impulse control went out the window. I’ve spent more money in the past week on dumb stuff than I have in two months. Making careless mistakes, watching more porn, just feeling off. Like I’m not in control of myself. I hate that feeling.  

I don’t regret my decision because it reminded me why I stopped in the first place. Sometimes you have to go back to something to fully understand why you left it behind. And what I’ve realized is the thing I hate most is feeling unconfident, weird, and anxious around people I love. I’m not willing to feel like that again.  

So I’m done with it. The past two weeks reminded me of exactly what I don’t want in my life. I'm going to the beach this week with friends and I think it is the perfect time to stop. I don't want to feel weird and socially anxious around my lifelong friends on vacation!

Thing is I was already addicted to masturbation and porn, so when I picked up weed it made the addiction even worse. I didn't know weed could make you so horny, it literally messes with your libido alot, and even when I was aware of this it was so hard to quit cuz I was chasing a high every single day. My tolerance was through the roof, but even with a high tolerance it will still make you horny. 

I've had enough though, weed did nothing but left me broke and stagnant in not just life but my bad habits, I had no drive to better my life, everything was just getting worse since I started smoking, enough is enough.

I was so depressed and anxious as a teenager, I couldn’t help but use it. I’m 26 now and it’s time to grow up and move on to the next chapter of my life.

I’ve been to some people’s houses lately that reek of weed, people often older and more mature than I am. Even my own father is an all day everyday smoker, always has been. My immediate thought when I smell it is, “ugh… really? Grow up, it’s not doing you any favors.” I am aware of how hypocritical that is. Maybe it really helps some people, maybe some people can do it all the time. But I cannot and I don’t think most people should, part of me thinks no one should. But everyone’s on their own path just as much as I am.

I didn’t think I’d ever get here, I thought I’d be fighting the urge for the rest of my life. But in sobriety I came to understand the person that I want to be, and that person does not, and cannot, rely on weed. That person is driven, focused, hard-working, clear-headed, loving, social, and community-minded.

In sobriety I’ve been getting much more into reading. Honestly, big thank you to David Foster Wallace for writing Infinite Jest. It has some of the most eloquent writing on addiction/sobriety of all forms that I’ve ever read and it’s given me so much to think about. Thank you to all of you who told your stories that I read for years until I summoned the courage to end this.

1j42ul3,leaves,2025-03-05 13:17:58,"61 days, no smoke. It is truly worth it.","
When I was still very attached to weed, I had major doubts about whether I would ever stop craving it, liking it, missing it, etc. I was trying to quit every few days for the majority of 2024, and it drained all the life out of me. I can say that, in my personal experience, my perspective shift was the most powerful thing in helping me: I began to be grateful for the experience of such an attachment and the insights I was able to have about the ""worse"" parts of myself. I attempted acceptance (not meaning to stop trying) and practiced radical self-compassion. 

I’m not going to lie, though—I had the privilege of being able to move myself physically away from weed (with the help of family) by moving to a country where substances are very difficult to access. Because of that, a part of me feels that I’m not as eligible to speak on certain parts of the quitting process compared to those who quit with the temptation still present. However, it is possible to remove it physically without such a drastic change. 

Anyways, the withdrawals weren’t awful: very emotional, low appetite, but that was about all. I didn’t have any sleep issues. I felt quite hopeless for the reasons I expressed in the beginning. For me the cravings happened more around the 30-day mark because that’s when I first experienced great emotional discomfort since quitting. But finding regulation techniques without substances has been much more rewarding. 

I am sharing this because when I was deep within my attachment, I would read these types of posts for hours on end, trying to spark some hope within me that I would be okay—because it didn’t feel like I ever would be. But with the power of hindsight, I can say that it absolutely gets better. I know everyone says that, and it’s hard to believe, but it does. I can remember the sweet things I am doing with family—all of my happy moments—and I can DREAM! 

If I had any advice, it would be to believe in yourself and demolish any doubt, because what you feed your subconscious through your thoughts and feelings is extremely powerful. You are loved.

1j3j02u,leaves,2025-03-04 19:20:11,"I Smoked Heavy for 9 Years, and I Think It’s Messed Me Up Permanently","
I started smoking weed every day when I was 15—at least 3+ grams a day, never missing a single day for 9 years. By the time I was 21, the quality of the weed I was smoking went up substantially, and I feel like that’s when things really started to change for me.

I quit three months ago and have only had a little bit every second weekend since then, but even the smallest amount absolutely wrecks me. My brain fog comes back instantly, and for days afterward, I struggle to recall simple things—like where I parked my car at a shopping center. My anxiety also goes through the roof. It feels like any little thing can set me off, and I hate the way it makes me feel.

I’m starting to feel like I’ve done irreversible damage to my brain from years of heavy smoking. Has anyone else experienced this? Does it ever get better? I’ve already quit for three months, and I feel some improvement, but the moment I touch it again, I go right back to square one. I’d love to hear from others who have been through this.

Edit -

Thanks for all the replies, it really means a lot. It’s just frustrating because the people I work with have been smoking way longer than me—they smoke all day, even at work, and still function better than I do sober. Meanwhile, I could only smoke at night, and even then, it would still mess me up the next day. I also always mixed tobacco with it, which probably made it even worse. I actually quit smoking cigarettes because they made me feel shaky and gave me brief bouts of anxiety. When I first started smoking weed, I had a lot of anxiety about my health and even saw a psychologist. But once I got into it, it was like it put a fog over my thoughts, and I stopped worrying so much. That worked for a while, but by the time I hit 20, the anxiety and paranoia started creeping back in. Looking back, I wonder if I was just numbing myself instead of actually dealing with it.

Next month is my fourth month being unemployed and I won’t even be eligible for food stamps anymore as they only allow three months. Going from having food on the table to being worried if you’ll eat the next month is something I wouldn’t wish on my worst enemy.

1j6gtjg,leaves,2025-03-08 13:09:41,"3 months clean - Side Effects, Timing and Guidance Post","History (33M):

Began smoking consistently in 2014.. turned into religiously in 2018 (weeknights after work anywhere from 5:00 PM - I fell asleep) and weekends with no limits.. This included joints, blunts, bong rips, edibles and once in a while pens.. $ was never an issue b/c I was flipping buds simultaneously.. 

**12/1/24** was the last day I touched any THC.  I finally decided that I want to see what my body, sleep and motivation would be like straight edge (without relying on any substance and having ZERO THC in my system).  Additionally, my munchies were so bad that my munchies had the munchies!! (I was almost 200 pounds and should be 175).

Side Effects 1st month:

1. Restless (difficulty falling asleep, waking up every few hours, crazy dreams/nightmares)

2. Crabby with mood swings

3. Random depression episodes (things that I would do HIGH were not ""fun"" anymore...)

**1/3/25 -** I decided to get my ass back in the gym to double down on working on my body and tiring myself out.  This consisted of the following: **Heavy Lifting** with cardio 5 days a week (**cardio HIGH INCLINE MID SPEED FOR 30 MINUTES** \- you should be breathing heavily but still be able to have a conversation and sweat your ass off) and eating a shitload of protein (protein in my cold brew for breakfast, tuna egg whites for lunch etc), DRINKING WATER ALL DAY and cutting sugar out (replace sweets with deserts with no added sugar and diet sodas). 

Within the **second** week of working out and dieting, I began to feel AMAZING .. as if I was an 18 year old boy again:

1. Sleeping 7-8 hours consistently (having CRAZIER dreams now which is sign of healthy back to life REM - note - weed actually hurts your sleep as much as it makes you think it's beneficial)

2. Motivation and concentration - these two things improve so much that you really don’t realize the negative impact weed has on this until you are CLEAN.  My work improved drastically, I don't procrastinate on things like planning trips, getting organized or things that took the back-burner for what feels like forever...

3. Memory - I now remember not only short team but also long term which I feel like you lose grasp of with consistent smoking.  This one is a like an added perk you don’t realize until you get it.  

4. HAPPY - I now I still play video games, watch movies have sex and do the same shit I did high and it's just as fun.

**3/8/25 -** 184 pounds (losing 1-2 week), I sleep like a rock (8 hours a night), sex drive is high, NATURAL SEROTONIN IS FULLY BACK, and i've never been happier.

**Summary**: PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE FIGHT THROUGH THE FIRST 1-2 MONTHS!! I know it sucks and you are tempted to revert back to smoking; but this is just your body beginning to cleanse itself and **get back to normal.** Also I cannot emphasize this enough.. WALK, RUN, PLAY PICK UP SPORTS, HIT THE GYM, CUT OUT SUGAR AND ALCOHOL (only have occasionally)  and this will speed the process up SIGNIFICANTLY.  You will come out a new person, highly motivated, confident and most importantly, happy without having to rely on shit! <33

1j7kyyo,leaves,2025-03-09 23:34:06,One month sober after 26 1/2 years,"Hi all, 42/m here. A month ago, I finally made the decision to clean myself out after over a quarter century of smoking, and more recently vaping. 

By the time I quit, I was hitting the vape at least 10 times a day, and at least two bowls at night. Maybe not considered to be power-puffing by some folks’ standards, but the addiction had its claws deep in me. I got to the point where I didn’t want to spend one second sober. I stayed in outer space.

The detox has been tricky, but daily walks/running/weightlifting has been a lifesaver. My body is still confused. My body temperature has been all over the place. My resting heart rate has spiked by about 10 beats per minute, which is interesting, but common. The sleep took a while to come back, but I’m finally sleeping through the night and the dreams are just as vivid as everyone says.

The emotional roller coaster has been pretty uncomfortable at times - just ask my wife, lol - but it’s all worth it. I feel like a completely different person. I started when I was 16 so I have never had this level of mental clarity as an adult.

I had known for years that I needed to do it, and was terrified. It was the best decision I’ve ever made.

I just wanted to share this with anyone who might be considering quitting, and can’t bring themselves to step through it. Trust me, it’s worth it. If my addicted ass can do it, so can you. Besides, you wouldn’t be here if you weren’t already thinking about.

1j66hqc,leaves,2025-03-08 01:59:01,Struggling with the fact that I should not inhale weed any more,"I am struggling with the concept and reality of not being able to smoke weed any more. I am 26 year old male, going on 27. I have smoked roughly 300/365 days a year for 10 years, since I was 16. With it being an every day thing since 21. I primarily smoked hash rosin via a dab rig, but also smoked flower from a bong and joint (less frequently). For me it helped my mental stress and anxiety. It was a way to relax and take the edge off - although I’d abuse at times and be high when I “shouldn’t have been”.

Two days ago I was on my way to work driving and I decided to take a few puffs of my dab pen which was acquired from a legal state. I noticed a slight chest pain after the first puff but brushed it off and continued my 30 min commute. As I was about 5min from my office, I took a 2nd puff and within 3 min I felt extreme back pain and shortness of breath. This followed by extreme chest pain.

Thankfully I was pulling into the parking deck as these extreme symptoms were happening. I was able to park and had to lie on the cold concrete in an attempt to catch my breath. I was also very hot and started sweating.


I made the decision call to a family member to come and get me because after a few minutes the symptoms were not going away. I was taken to an urgent care where I had chest X-rays and they determined I was suffering from a spontaneous pneumothorax or partially collapsed left lung. They referred me to the ER right away. This scared the shit out of me… I knew smoking wasn’t good for me, but I was able to justify it because I didn’t smoke tobacco or nicotine products, vapes etc. I considered what I was doing “healthier”.

Made it to the ER and they confirmed I indeed had a partially collapsed left lung. Thankfully it was small enough that they suggested keeping me overnight on high flow oxygen to see if the lung Re-inflates and if the dead space in my chest cavity would shrink as my lung fills back up. No chest tubes or air drainage was necessary. The next day I was discharged and now at home recovering. 

I was told by the doctor that my smoking habits increased my risk factor for this happening even though it might not have caused the collapse on its own. They said tall/skinny males are more likely to suffer a spontaneous pneumothorax than those who aren’t. Long story short, they said that anything besides fresh air in my lungs will significantly increase my changes of a second collapse. 

I am home now and feeling better, but struggling with the fact that I can’t (or shouldn’t) ever smoke again. 

If you were a frequent marijuana smoker, how were you able to cope with not being able to smoke any more?

1jdv4wz,leaves,2025-03-18 02:43:33,I’m done. I. AM. DONE.,"It’s been a problem for nearly a decade. I know I don’t need to explain to you guys why.

But, I’ve fucked up for the LAST. FUCKING. TIME.

My mom has early onset Alzheimer’s. She’s only 60, diagnosed at 55. I’m her daughter and healthcare proxy. She lives with me and it’s been the most depressing, heartbreaking, completely soul destroying thing I’ve ever been through. It’s part of the reason I was still smoking throughout it all. It’s the only thing that numbs the pain.

This past Saturday, we brought her in for a UTI test (super common with Alz)…and long story short, everything snowballed and she’s now in the hospital for mental evaluation and hasn’t come home. I stayed by her side for 8 hours that day. They were waiting on someone to show up and evaluate her, but they never showed. When I left, they told me they should be there by 9 pm and to expect a call at 9. So, I went home. 9 pm came and went. It was past 10 pm when I assumed they probably weren’t going to call. The person they were waiting on was probably going to show up in the morning and I’d probably get a call then.

So…I went outside and smoked. I came back inside, went back into my room, sat down…and the phone rang. The *moment* I sat down. I panicked and didn’t answer. Gave myself 15 minutes or so to calm down…my blood pressure had suddenly gone through the roof and it felt like my whole body was shaking. I called back and the call went…okay. But, I made a promise to myself. No more weed. I can’t risk being out of it if something happens and they really need me.

The next day (yesterday), I visited mom. She seemed fine, thankfully. Passive, content, agreeable, and cooperative with the nurses. I was so worried she was going to be upset, miserable, feeling like I’d abandoned her. But, things seemed to be going surprisingly well. So, when I went home, I felt a bit better about leaving her in there, knowing she was doing okay.

And then that little stoner devil on my shoulder whispered in my ear. “Things are calm right now. You saw her and the nurses today. Everything is fine, at least for tonight. You’re clear for tonight. It’s safe. Just a couple puffs, that’s all.” At around 11 pm (they’re definitely not going to call that late, right?), I broke my promise. And I went outside and smoked.

And I shit you not, the MOMENT I got back to my room…the phone rang. It was the hospital. They want to Section 12 her. I could hear that even the girl on the phone was trying to stay professional and trying not to cry. It’s an awful conversation to have in general, but sucks a whole hell of a lot more when you’re high. These are not decisions you should be making when you’re fucking *high*.

If that wasn’t a *definite* sign, I don’t know what is. The moment I hung up the phone, I pulled out my stash box. I took everything out of it, took out all my prerolls, ripped them all the fuck up, dumped it all the into an old, half-full cup of Dunkin that had been sitting for days (gross, I know lol) and mixed it up (just as an extra “fuck you” to it), and flushed it. (Upon hindsight, probably not the best choice of disposal, but whatever.)

I’m fucking *done* and I don’t fucking care what withdrawal symptoms I might go through. This shit has completely fucked up my life. Destroyed my friendships and relationships, affected my work, my mental health, my physical heath, and threw me into a never ending cycle of existential crises. I should’ve stopped this *years* ago. I’ve essentially missed the last good years of my mother’s life, when she was living RIGHT in my OWN home. I feel like such a fucking failure…I’ve failed as a daughter. I’ve failed her. I wasn’t there for her the way I should have been. All because I was too lost in my own fog.

I’m fucking DONE! I want to go to every dispensary around here and buy as much weed as I can, just so I can fucking destroy it. It stole my life. And now it’s too little, too late… I fucking hate it. I *hate* it. And I’m never fucking going near it again.",124,15,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/1jdv4wz/im_done_i_am_done/,Im done DONE problem nearly decade know dont need explain guys Ive fucked LAST FUCKING TIME mom early onset Alzheimers Shes 60 diagnosed 55 Im daughter healthcare proxy lives depressing heartbreaking completely soul destroying thing Ive ever part reason still smoking throughout thing numbs pain past Saturday brought UTI test super common Alzand long story short everything snowballed shes hospital mental evaluation hasnt come home stayed side 8 hours day waiting someone show evaluate never showed left told 9 pm expect call 9 went home 9 pm came went past 10 pm assumed probably werent going call person waiting probably going show morning Id probably get call SoI went outside smoked came back inside went back room sat downand phone rang moment sat panicked didnt answer Gave 15 minutes calm downmy blood pressure suddenly gone roof felt like whole body shaking called back call wentokay made promise weed cant risk something happens really need next day yesterday visited mom seemed fine thankfully Passive content agreeable cooperative nurses worried going upset miserable feeling like Id abandoned things seemed going surprisingly well went home felt bit better leaving knowing okay little stoner devil shoulder whispered ear Things calm right saw nurses today Everything fine least tonight Youre clear tonight safe couple puffs thats around 11 pm theyre definitely going call late right broke promise went outside smoked shit MOMENT got back roomthe phone rang hospital want Section 12 could hear even girl phone trying stay professional trying cry awful conversation general sucks whole hell lot youre high decisions making youre fucking high wasnt definite sign dont know moment hung phone pulled stash box took everything took prerolls ripped fuck dumped old halffull cup Dunkin sitting days gross know lol mixed extra fuck flushed Upon hindsight probably best choice disposal whatever Im fucking done dont fucking care withdrawal symptoms might go shit completely fucked life Destroyed friendships relationships affected work mental health physical heath threw never ending cycle existential crises shouldve stopped years ago Ive essentially missed last good years mothers life living RIGHT home feel like fucking failureIve failed daughter Ive failed wasnt way lost fog Im fucking DONE want go every dispensary around buy much weed fucking destroy stole life little late fucking hate hate Im never fucking going near

I’m wondering if there are others out there who have had a similar experience to mine. I’m in my 70’s, my weed smoking over five decades never stopped me from having a successful career and family, and I would take breaks for weeks at a time. The last time I took a break, back in November 2024, my body reacted violently. I felt like I had electricity coursing through my body, I couldn’t sleep, my anxiety was off the charts. I tried smoking to relieve my symptoms, but it actually made it worse. I went to an addiction medicine clinic, was put on meds, and started attending MA meetings and seeing a psychologist. With all this support, I’m now 45 days clean, tapering off the meds, and getting regular therapy and group support. It’s still not easy, but I learned that marijuana IS addictive, and I’m fully up to the challenge of being weed free, something I never imagined for myself.

1j5u3qi,leaves,2025-03-07 17:19:33,One year weed free!,"I can’t believe it. One whole year of not smoking a single bit of weed. 

If you had told me a year ago that I’d make it this far, I wouldn’t have believed you. I couldn’t have imagined it back then. 

I won’t lie to you, the first 4-6 weeks were pure hell. I was SO grumpy, anxious, and distraught. Every hour I chose not to smoke felt like a win, and the nighttime was a special sort of hell. I had trouble sleeping and was generally just unpleasant to be around. 

But after 4 weeks, things got so much better. I still craved it, but I wasn’t so anxious and grumpy anymore. And then after 6 weeks, I was entirely okay. I got my spark back. I was ME again. 

And now here we are, one year later! I don’t think about it at all, and I’m a happier and better person for it. I don’t constantly make sure my stash is supplied. I don’t constantly think about how I’m going to sneak in a smoke when I go out with friends, or worry about how I’m going to get it when I’m out of town. Not being tied to it has been so, so freeing! 

The number one thing that helped me was to replace the habit with something else. For me, it was hot baths and a cup of tea. Every time I felt like I was going to break down I’d either take a hot bath or have a cup of tea. In those first few weeks, I’d often take 2-3 baths a day. But having a go-to activity to replace the craving was the only thing that helped. The best part is that the tea habit stuck, and now I drink 1-3 cups of tea a day and feel so much healthier for it!  I also read this subreddit a lot, and it helped me not feel so alone in the journey.

I’m here to say — YOU CAN DO IT! I promise! 

I was smoking multiple times a day, every single day for YEARS. I couldn’t remember the last time I had gone a day without it, and I’d go through an eighth in a few days. So if I can do it, you can too!

1jf1t3k,leaves,2025-03-19 16:59:26,"quit cold turkey, I can't do it anymore","I've (F28) smoked joints daily for a year straight and decided to quit cold turkey almost 6 days ago. I don't know what I was thinking but it was the worst decision of my life.

I completely underestimated the possibility of withdrawal symptoms because I've been in denial of the severity of my addiction for so long.

The physical symptoms (loss of appetite, severe weight drop in only a few days, night and cold sweats, abdominal pain, loose stool), and the psychological aftermath (random emotional outbursts, tantrums, uncontrollable crying sessions to the point of tingling in my face, arms and hands (numbness?)) have taken its toll on me.

I can't stand being here anymore. I'm not actively thinking of suicide but I wish I wasn't here anymore. I have a very supportive partner whom I've subjected to so much injustice. I can't control my emotions and anger anymore. I don't understand the emotions I'm feeling. I feel so much pain and guilt for not being able to control myself. I feel like a child. I take offense in everything.

With all due respect, but what the fuck have I been smoking all this time and what the fuck is going on with me?

Will it ever get better for me? I've not felt anything like this before. I don't recognise myself anymore. I hate what I've become.

1j7mx4v,leaves,2025-03-10 01:10:11,What I Learned In 34 Days of Sobriety:,"Backstory: I got sober from alcohol about 2 years ago, but my weed intake went WAY up when I quit drinking. I started smoking weed when I was 24. It started with every other weekend and by 26, it was 3-4 times/week. By 29, I was smoking daily, and at 30, I quit drinking, which made me smoke even more - multiple times per day half the days, but always nightly before bed to stave off the nightmares & be able to eat. I'll be 32 in a month. I've been sober from weed 34 days. My experience is mine alone & is not intended to be a guidebook for fellow sobriety travelers. This is what I've learned:

1. I am so much better equipped to handle life's stressors when my brain is not bogged up with a substance. 
2. Insomnia was rough for the first week, as were the nightmares, but those subsided for me completely by week 3, I was sleeping soundly & dreaming for the first time in my life. 
3. The myriad of emotions I am able to feel... is breathtaking. I cry even more than I used to, but I've always been emotional. I cry at life's joys equally as much as I cry at life's pains. But the joy & pain I feel in experiencing everything fully is remarkable and 100% worth it to me.
4. I'm surprised at how confident I feel in continuing to maintain my sobriety. In the back of my mind, I thought I would get to 30 days & head to the store for a joint. But I don't want that, not at all. I feel stronger than my addictions, for the first time in my life.
5. Regulating my nervous system is so much easier when I'm sober. 
6. I rekindled my loves of reading books and of writing poetry. 
7. Memories I've really never pondered have flooded to me in random moments. Some from childhood, even. It's strange and sometimes scary, but comforting knowing I'm no longer abandoning my inner child or my adult self.
8. There are so many hours in one day! When I was smoking daily, I would always go, ""where did the day go?? Each day is so short!"" But they're not, at least not when you're present. I can get so much done in one day. I'm never bored anymore. I always have something I can do. Which bring me to...
9. Exercise is fun! I have my full lung capacity! I'm not out of shape; I was just bogging my lungs down with resin! Wild! Also, an add on: I had no idea my armpits would REEK when I sweat. About 3 weeks in, I started smelling what I called my 'dank stank'. Cause.. really. You would have thought I was smoking with how I smelled. I have worn natural deodorant for YEARS, but I've had to wear the real stuff the past few weeks. And shower more often, sometimes twice a day.
10. I'm smart and capable. I know things. Sometimes I start going off about something at work and it's like an out of body experience.  I feel like I'm floating above the conversation, watching people genuinely take interest in what I'm saying because I'M SMART! Who knew?! 
11. Keeping up with friendships feels more genuine and it is easier to remember that I have friends who want to hear about my life & I really want to hear about theirs. On a similar note, I'm a better partner. I notice things about my wife I didn't notice before. On an even greater note? I'm a present parent. I delight in my child's joys and I have more tolerance to relate to and spend time with her. 
12. Hunger happens now! I thought I'd never be hungry again, but I am! At regular intervals!

1j6tm1o,leaves,2025-03-08 23:08:00,This mindset made quitting possible,"I was a daily smoker for about 13 years and knew I desperately needed to change. I am a naturally introverted guy but weed pounded me into isolation and made me feel disconnected from my life. I tried and failed many times to quit, but I compulsively kept going back to daily smoking. I felt paralyzed. I knew with 110% certainty that if I remained in my addiction, I was going to be miserable. So I kept trying. I had to do some deep soul searching and figure out why I was struggling so bad to step away. The simple answer was fear. I was afraid of the withdrawals, afraid quitting was going to be too uncomfortable, afraid of feeling empty without weed, afraid I wouldn’t have the perseverance to make it to the other side. Afraid it was going to be too much. 

I knew I had to change the way I thought about quitting. Trying to hide from the challenging parts of quitting amplified the fear. I made the conscious decision to try and mentally flip it completely on its head: I told myself every single craving, every difficult feeling, every triggering circumstance, every negative thought that could possibly come my way during my abstinence was not only a *good thing* but also a major *blessing*. I knew that every time I experienced a challenge after quitting and stuck to abstinence, I was dealing a mortal blow to my addiction. 

Now, this didn’t click with me right away; there was a period of “fake it till you make it”. I thanked the universe and told myself it was a good thing and a blessing for every single tough moment I experienced. I remember once I was tossing and turning at 3am with insomnia and muttered “good” to myself lol. I wasn’t thriving during early sobriety, I was surviving. But I stuck with this mindset and it’s truly crazy how the tables turn once you reframe your fears. 

It took about 10 days for me to experience the first benefit of quitting- I had some mental clarity I hadn’t experienced in a long time. Attaining that first benefit paired with my mental reframe was huge for me because it felt like there was legitimate substance to this mental concept of my fears being gifts. It became easier and easier to stick with mindset and strangely enough, when withdrawals would come around in the coming days/weeks/months, I found myself smiling and saying “this is amazing, my brain is still healing and I have more growth to experience”. The feelings became genuine. I promise you, this whole quitting thing is infinitely easier and even enjoyable when you’re no longer afraid.

1j5th10,leaves,2025-03-07 16:58:03,"53 Days Sober – Daily Smoker for 13 Years, Here’s What I’ve Learned","I started smoking at 17 and kept going every day until I was 30. I smoked it all—carts, dabs, blunts, bong rips—whatever was available. At my worst, I had to be high before leaving the house, no matter where I was going or what I was doing. I wasn’t just smoking for fun; it became my baseline. I didn’t fall asleep—I passed out.

I had only tried to quit three times before. Twice, I lasted less than a week. The longest I had ever gone was 17 days, about seven months ago, before I gave in and went right back to daily use.

But this time, I’ve made it to 53 days sober, and everything feels different. My diet has improved, I’m actually consistent in the gym, and I’m locked in at work like never before. I no longer need to fight the grogginess, anxiety, and brain fog that came with being high all the time. The cycle of wake, bake, repeat is finally broken.

Two things that helped me more than anything:

	1.	For the first time ever, I got rid of everything. Every bit of paraphernalia, every last crumb—completely gone from my house. No safety net, no temptation sitting in a drawer. That made a massive difference.

	2.	Using a sobriety tracker and counting hours instead of days. Seeing the numbers go up hour by hour was way more motivating than just thinking in days or weeks. It kept me focused and gave me small wins to build on.

And one of the biggest lessons I’ve learned: if you truly want to quit for yourself, it’s a lot easier than if you’re doing it for someone else. You have to want it. Otherwise, you’ll always find an excuse to go back.

If you’re reading this and thinking about quitting—just start. Even if you’ve failed before, even if it feels impossible, you can break the cycle. And once you do, you might be surprised at how much better life feels on the other side.",82,18,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/1j5th10/53_days_sober_daily_smoker_for_13_years_heres/,53 Days Sober Daily Smoker 13 Years Heres Ive Learned started smoking 17 kept going every day 30 smoked allcarts dabs blunts bong ripswhatever available worst high leaving house matter going wasnt smoking fun became baseline didnt fall asleepI passed tried quit three times Twice lasted less week longest ever gone 17 days seven months ago gave went right back daily use time Ive made 53 days sober everything feels different diet improved Im actually consistent gym Im locked work like never longer need fight grogginess anxiety brain fog came high time cycle wake bake repeat finally broken Two things helped anything 1 first time ever got rid everything Every bit paraphernalia every last crumbcompletely gone house safety net temptation sitting drawer made massive difference 2 Using sobriety tracker counting hours instead days Seeing numbers go hour hour way motivating thinking days weeks kept focused gave small wins build one biggest lessons Ive learned truly want quit lot easier youre someone else want Otherwise youll always find excuse go back youre reading thinking quittingjust start Even youve failed even feels impossible break cycle might surprised much better life feels side
1je1dom,leaves,2025-03-18 09:58:34,365 days...,"**365 fucking days.**

**365 days since I said goodbye to the haze.** 

**365 days since I stopped listening to the voice inside me that whispered “just one more hit”.** 

**365 days since I stopped being the ghost in my own life...** 

\-

This year has been a war and a rebirth. It has been a year of showing up for myself - every single day - whether I felt like it or not. 

A year of yoga mats, gym floors, walks in the mountains - all the places where I rebuilt my goddamn life. Where I unfucked my brain.

A year ago I made a promise to myself. That I would stop looking in the mirror and seeing disappointment. That there would be no more half-measures. No more “high-functioning” lies. That the solution couldn’t be moderation…that it had to be sobriety.

Because here’s the truth I’ve learnt for myself - I’m either all-in…or I’m drowning. And I had been drowning for too long.

\-

Weed was my oldest companion. The thing that traveled with me across countries and careers, through breakups and loss, all the while slowly eroding my edges until I felt like a smudge in the margins of my own story. 

It wasn’t easy. The first weeks were a warzone of cravings, and temptation from the lies of “just this once” and “you’ve not smoked in weeks - you can moderate now”. Pure and utter addict brain bullshit. 

But that voice telling me to smoke away the hard moments was getting weaker each time I made the right choice. And making the right choice itself became easier as each day passed.

\-

249 days into cannabis sobriety, I made another choice. I decided to face the secret rum bottles that were starting to pile up in my closet. 

I had traded one addiction for another - one that was going to put me in an early grave. 

I told my wife. I told my family, my friends. I told every bar tender in town not to serve me. 

There is no doubt in my mind that - like weed and tobacco - I will never touch alcohol again.

\-

How can I be so sure? Because 520 days since my last cigarette, 365 days since my last joint, and 116 days since my last drink, my life is now filled with beautiful moments.

Waking up, drinking tea while I watch the sun rise over the mountains. Nights staying up late and talking with my wife about our hopes, dreams and fears…no longer dulled by smoke or haze. 

Hours spent finding my dopamine and serotonin rushes on the yoga mat, or amongst the trees in the mountains that surround me. Beautiful memories made in new countries, the travel funded by what I used to smoke away each month. 

Remembering names, birthdays, and important things loved ones share with me.

Laughter that doesn’t need a buzz to feel real. Dancing around the house instead of dragging my feet.

My body? It’s stronger, sharper, healthier. A testament to every sunrise I honored with discipline.

\-

Some days are still hard. Some nights, old ghosts linger at the edges. Life doesn’t magically stop throwing shit at you just because you’ve started making good choices. But I don’t need a crutch to face things anymore.

I don’t have to be a ghost in my own live. 

I choose to live free, and I will NEVER go back.

Thank you to everyone here who provided support. Who shared their own successes and failures. Who allowed themselves to be honest and vulnerable with internet strangers. Because of you, I'm celebrating 1 year sober. 

If you're reading this and struggling, I hope my post will pay it forward and help you realize that you don't have to be a ghost in your own life. You ARE able to beat this. You ARE worth it.

I did not/do not want to stop smoking but my body is now like rejecting it I don’t know how else to explain it. Debilitating anxiety crushes me even with even 1 toke. It was so bad I thought I was having a heart attack and had my wife call an ambulance a couple weeks ago. 
Have not smoked since but last night tried to eat a couple of 10mg gummies and it turned into a bad experience again. Mind you I used to eat 100mg as a baseline just a few weeks prior. Id wake n bake a bowl, smoke couple times throughout the day and end my nite with dabs/edibles. I enjoyed & consumed cannabis in every form. Weed is a lot more then just getting high for me it was/is my favorite hobby. I loved learning about new strains and their lineage. Finding the best growers with exclusive genetics. Using the newest cutting edge technologies for consumption, started a glass collection etc. 
My dream was to one day retire from my back breaking job (Union Ironworker mainly rebar) and grow pot for the rest of my days. 
So to say the least this is very hard for me to wrap my head around right now. I’ve had to stop several times throughout my 20 years for work related reasons so I’m aware of the withdrawal symptoms like the nite sweats, loss of appetite etc. usually the 1st 10 days suck but after that I was pretty good but I never took an extended break. Was always just to clear out my system to pass a test. But I never dealt with anxiety like this and the anxiety only seems to arise when I consume cannabis, at least to the point where it’s like a panic attack.

1jjnyhp,leaves,2025-03-25 16:47:50,To the Engineers/Programmers in here: We’re way sharper without it,"I mean it’s just undeniable. 

For context, I quit smoking for 4 years from 2019-2023, during which time I finished school and became a full time engineer. I had to make a deal with the universe that I would give up my biggest crutch and vice (smoking and really drinking too but mostly smoking) in order to get what I really wanted (a 6 figure SWE role right out of school….lol I’m being honest here). And during that time, I remained sober and achieved my goal. The level of commitment and focus that I had during those years was insane. I was studying every single day for hours, preparing for interviews everyday for hours. 

Anyway, in 2024, after I was well settled into my job, I started feeling confident and started smoking again. BIG MISS STEAK.

My growth really slowed down, my memory was impacted, I procrastinated so much, I was just kind of getting by instead of really growing as an engineer. I did get promoted, but the possibility of getting to senior level while using this crutch was just not likely. I also started to feel like maybe I am not built for this and had no real purpose, I should get a new career, AI is taking over anyway, and smoked the anxiety away. 

So now I am about 6 weeks clean, which is nothing compared to the 4 years of sobriety before, and wow lmao. The difference in my work ethic, my ability to retain info again and to trapeze through my codebase like a monkey is back like never before. Now I just take more initiative, code for longer periods of time, don’t take smoke breaks mid-day because I just got stuck and don’t know what to do about it. I churn out more PRs more quickly.

1j2cveg,leaves,2025-03-03 06:57:57,“Getting clean’s the easy part. Now comes life” 55 days clean.,"A quote from a character called Waylon from The Wire. 

I think if I had to sum up my experience being sober for the nearly past two months in one sentence, it would be this. I don’t mean to discourage any people trying to quit, because getting clean is not necessarily easy. But it really does resonate with me heavily, and maybe with some of you as well. 

I, like many of others in the sub, struggled immensely with my mental health growing up and turned to marijuana. Now that I am on my journey to recovery, it has really opened my eyes to what feelings I was trying to suppress and shove back down, never to be addressed. 

I was addicted heavily to weed during college, and started smoking when I was 16. I moved back home last fall, to live with my single mother with whom I never had a good relationship, further straining it with my drug addiction. 

Recently life has been quite bleak if im being honest. My long term girlfriend is breaking up with me because she doesn’t feel secure in our future together.  I didn’t really figure my shit out during college and don’t have a career lined up while she’s starting medical school soon. Take a wild guess as to why I didn’t take college as seriously as I should have. 

Moreover I discovered that I have gum disease in part due to not taking care of myself because of depression and because of how much pot I was smoking. It really is a slippery slope. 

Unfortunately I don’t have health insurance either, because in my country you are not deemed worthy of healthcare unless you have a full time job, which is really hard to find now, even with a STEM degree and hundreds of applications. 

On the brighter side though, if I was still smoking weed these problems would inevitably cascade further and further until I really reached rock bottom. I’ve taken steps to try and improve my physical and mental health in ways that I can; taking more care of my teeth routinely, starting a gym membership and sticking to it, and committing to a strict study regiment so I can hopefully go to grad school, and accomplish my dreams that weed made me give up on. 

If I had any advice for someone trying to quit it would be to do it for yourself. Because you may be trying to avoid a lot of the daily turmoils of life with this drug. But let me be the one to tell you that it will only get worse if you dig yourself deeper into that hole. I believe in you. We all do. Your physical and mental health is more important than the quick high you get from weed. Trust me. 

To 90 days and beyond, hopefully. ❤️

This is harder than I thought and I’ve quit addictions to much more physically addicting substances.","Hi guys! Making a step to join this community for support. Hope I’m welcome. 


Took me way too long to realize this, I’m an addict when it comes to weed. thinking it’s an innocent little drug keeps me coming back always, even though it’s far from it. 

Literally, if I just want to blaze once it will lead me into a month/two month long binge of vaping all day everyday, resulting in me neglecting all other facets of life. (About a gram of highest quality oil per day during my binge, easily 700+mg thc) 

When I’d come out of the binge, I’d have gained so much weight, lived my months in a total haze, jeopardized my relationships & progress towards goals I’d had set for myself. And be severely depressed, even suicidal ideation. The withdrawals of heavy use are insane. 

After coming out of the binge, I come to realize it really does NOTHING positive for my life other than feel slightly good for a while. I don’t blame weed, I blame myself becoming addicted to it. 

I’m not going to lie, I may have been off of it for a few months now, but can’t guarantee I won’t again relapse and go into same old phase. 

For me personally, I think the two worst parts about weed are how terribly bad it affects your sleep, which in turn effects every other part of your day, and also how it makes you feel just ok, resulting in you feeling content and not going out & achieving your goals. 


I think I’m going to seek therapy because I haven’t been able to successfully quit by myself (I have a lot of child hood & life trauma which I thought I overcame but apparently havent.)

I am more clear minded, I can focus more and I don't stutter nearly as much as I did. My anxiety and social anxiety is probably down like 90% from what it was when I used to smoke. I tried to quit so many times but I'm glad I stuck it out this time. Work is a lot better and my relationships are so much more meaningful. 

I still do get cravings not going to lie, but its nothing that I would act on and as soon as I do I realise how much better life is without weed and I have to deal with whats going on rather than avoiding it by smoking.

1j9fu5k,leaves,2025-03-12 09:05:25,Quitting Weed After a Decade – My Journey from Nepal to the Netherlands,"I want to share my story of quitting weed after almost ten years, hoping it might help someone out there who’s struggling.

Background – Growing Up in Nepal

I grew up in Nepal, where expectations were everything. My parents always wanted me to become a doctor or an engineer. I was a top student as a kid—always ranking first in my class until I slipped. The first time I placed fourth, I was punished harshly. That pressure stayed with me, making me feel like my worth was tied to my achievements.

After high school, I was pushed into engineering, but I hated it. I dropped out, then tried IT, but that wasn’t for me either. What I really loved was music, especially bass guitar. But in Nepal, choosing music over a ""respectable"" career was almost unheard of. Eventually, I took the risk and pursued music full-time.

Becoming a Full-Time Musician in Nepal

Once I decided to follow music, things picked up quickly. I became a busy session bassist, playing gigs, recording for TV shows, and doing studio work. I was making money through music, something I never thought was possible in Nepal.

At the same time, I got deeper into jazz, fascinated by its complexity and freedom. But the more I learned, the more I realized how much I didn’t know. I wanted to go deeper, to truly understand the language of jazz and push myself as a musician. That’s what led me to apply for music school in the Netherlands.

How Weed Became a Part of My Life

When I first started smoking weed, it felt like freedom. It gave me an escape—from family pressure, from self-doubt, from the feeling that I had somehow failed in life by not following the traditional path. I convinced myself that weed was helping my creativity, that it was part of being a musician. It became a daily habit. I would wake up, smoke, and let the day drift by.

At first, it felt harmless. But over the years, I noticed things changing. I was practicing less, my motivation was fading, and I started feeling stuck. Instead of facing my problems, I would just smoke and push them aside.

Moving to the Netherlands & the Reality Check

Last year, I moved to the Netherlands to study jazz bass. It was a dream come true—a fresh start, a chance to grow as a musician. But instead of feeling inspired, I felt lost. The pressure of school, money, and expectations started weighing on me again. And weed, which had once felt like a friend, started feeling like an anchor, holding me back.

I would look at my bass and feel scared to even take it out of the bag. Days would pass without playing. My confidence was gone. I realized I wasn’t getting better—I was getting worse. And the worst part? I knew I was wasting my potential, but I felt powerless to change.

The Breaking Point & Quitting

One day, I just hit a wall. I was tired of feeling like a failure. Tired of escaping. I realized that if I wanted to be the musician I had dreamed of becoming, I had to actually put in the work. No more excuses. No more weed.

Now I’m in my second week of quitting, and I won’t lie—it’s still tough. My mind isn’t fully clear yet, and this past week has been rough. I’ve had panic attacks, felt exhausted, and struggled to focus. But despite that, I’m fighting. I’ve started running in the mornings, something I never thought I’d do. I’ve been exercising, trying to rebuild my energy and discipline. I know it’s going to take time, but I’m moving forward.

What I’ve Learned So Far

1. Weed doesn’t make you more creative—it just makes you comfortable with doing less.

2. Quitting is more than just stopping a habit—it’s about facing yourself and your fears.

3. Progress takes time, and that’s okay.

I’m not perfect. I still struggle with self-doubt, and I still have a long way to go. But I’m no longer stuck in the same cycle. If you’re out there, feeling trapped in your habits, thinking it’s too late to change—I promise you, it’s not.

Currently three days without. 
I’ve “tried” countless times but I always give in. My husband has health issues and he has a medicinal card. I would never ask him to stop. It only helps him and doesn’t hinder him. 

I’ve done therapy for three years. I know all the right answers but it’s like my brain and body goes into panic when I’m home and I can’t deal with my emotions. So far I’ve been able to not lash out at him but I am afraid I’ll fall back on bad habits. 

I know I have to keep myself accountable and not even ask if I can smoke. As I said this has been a long term issue he’s tried to help me with but he’s at his wits end. However, when we both get home from work it’s like the water works cannot stop. It feels awful. I feel I am abusing him just by having this large show of emotion. I know it’s partly anxiety and my brain is convinced I need it to calm myself but I also know that’s not true.

It does not feel like a choice to have these emotional outbursts full of tears but I know part of it is caused by me doing this over the years to essentially get what I think I deserve or need. I know has to be true because although I currently feel miserable, I am not crying, my heart is not racing and that’s because he’s not currently home. 

I know taking from him will immediately end the marriage because that’s why I’ve been given an ultimatum to begin with. Stealing and breaking our trust. He’s giving me a chance to rebuild this. He’s the love of my life so I truly can’t understand why I keep having these reactions knowing what’s on the line. 

I know my self worth is at an all time low due to bringing my husband to this breaking point but I know I am capable of quitting. I know it. 

I don’t know if I’m just venting or if I would like some words of advice but I feel so lost. I guess I’m wondering if anyone else has any type of similar situation and how you knocked some sense in yourself. 

I know it’s only been three days but I can’t keep doing this to him. I want to be the woman I used to be and the one he deserves.

What led me to quitting was an onset of awful indigestion/GERD about 2 weeks ago, bad enough to where I went to my doctor about it. Wound up being prescribed Pepcid which caused massive anxiety and insomnia after the second day. I stopped taking it over the weekend, insomnia faded, indigestion remained.

I was searching on here and found a comment that I thought was surely bullshit - that pot could be to blame. I had absolutely no interest in quitting pot but I couldn’t ignore the possibility so I resolved to take a short pause while I figured out my GI issues. That’s when all hell broke loose. 

Honestly, it feels just like a continuation of the adverse reaction to Pepcid. Waking up in hot sweats, general insomnia, anxiety, loss of appetite, erratic temperaments. I was absolutely ignorant that pot withdrawal was a real thing, but boy have I received an education.

I already have some mental clarity coming back but the sleep, temperature and appetite deregulation is a total headfuck. I’ve lost 8lbs in a week, 4 spoonfuls of anything is enough to make me nauseous. 

I never planned to quit for good but at this point I’m struggling to imagine I could willingly return to a habit that has done this to me. I’ve never felt so much like my life is at a crossroads; I’ve had depression my whole life but I feel a strength in me now and I can’t flush that down the drain.

1jm1uhi,leaves,2025-03-28 18:23:47,"The 3 that cannot be mixed - Porn, Weed, Video games","Hi all, today is day 1 of me quitting and I thought i'd ask for a few tips to help me along as i've failed to quit 20 times in the past 2 years. 
Just some context before I go on, I was introduced to cannabis at around 15. At the time it was the greatest thing for me and my mates, every weekend the main question would be where the next sesh was going to be. I then started smoking alone at home at around 16 occasionally but wasn't really into it that much doing it alone and hated doing it while school was on at the time. Then once I got to about 18 first year at university I discovered the power of playing video games while high and absolutely loved it. Fast forward another year or so to when i'm about 19 and I discovered getting high and watching porn which fired up my cravings and addiction even more. Now to the present day I find myself when playing video games without smoking not as engaging and almost like i'm missing out and wasting what could be me getting high and playing. This concept also follows into porn aswell, I find myself thinking everytime before watching it I need to have a smoke as it will make everything 100 times better and enjoyable. Does anyone else have these same thoughts aswell?. I believe it's due to me having an easy release of pleasure and dopamine from both sources which is causing me to keep running back to smoking again even when I tell myself this is it. This has become a daily thing for me whenever i'm not with my partner I tend to smoke or whenever I'm about to play video games I always think I need to smoke. I'm trying to move on from this habit as it's killing me in other areas of my life such as: 1. Obviously smoking it's not good for anyone no matter what you're inhaling 2. I'm always waking up feeling like doing absolutely nothing and having no energy except falling down this same path of smoking and watching porn before actually getting on with my day 3. Affecting my studies as I smoke most of the time during the day when I get those cravings from porn and video games which leads to me not wanting to do any work at all 4. my relationship, I feel like i could give my girlfriend so much more energy and love that she deserves if I just wasn't smoking constantly. No one knows about me smoking and i've kept it hidden for years but i've finally decided to try quit and move away. Does anyone have any tips on how to stop these cravings and not fall into them as everytime i've quit for around 5 days to a week before picking up again

1jkravm,leaves,2025-03-27 00:28:42,"Been trying to quit since 2023, posting for accountability's sake.","Howdy fine folks, last night I went on a late night walk and left my paraphernalia on a park bench where I know there's lots of homeless folks. I did this because even now with my deep hatred of this substance my addict brain still cannot let it go to waste. Anyway, throwing it in the trash just results in me humiliatingly digging through garbage and another innumerable broken promise.



Breaking this habit will mean a new chapter in my life as I have been a daily user since I turned 18. I kinda have a complicated cauldron of factors complicating this essential undertaking. I am neurodivergent and both my mom and dad are addicts. I always told myself I was gonna be different.  I guess I gotta take the L on this one.



Given my background, I was likely hooked from my first hit, though my recreational use did not immediately transition to abuse.  Weed was the best thing initially; I felt like I was rooted in the moment, had no anxiety, and everything from music to food was more pleasurable.  But imperceptibly through break ups, bad work days, and grief, weed increasingly became the only thing that I found solace in.  When life was inconsistent and let me down, I knew that my paraphernalia was locked and loaded for action, the instant I sealed myself away in my room.  Because I avoided life, it became more stressful and overwhelming which further cycled back into my isolation and substance abuse.



At this point in my relationship I realized that this could not continue.  It was slowly disinhibiting me in all manner of ways.  I got hooked on cigs, obsessively watched adult content, and would binge food till my wallet was empty and my stomach was taut. I think these other secondary addictions arose parallel with the big tolerance I was building. I just wanted it to hit as “magical” as it did when I was a teen. But at this point it just dulled my thoughts and brought on a deep unmotivated lethargy. 



I have made an attempt to quit every couple months since 2023 but always end up rooting through the garbage like a stupid little beagle. I find it easy to cut out many of the aforementioned bad habits, but my predilection for this plant is unmatched.  I will say that I always made sure to notate what combination of factors led to the relapse and have a lot of perspective after many tries. Brandon Novak’s recent appearance on “Soft White Underbelly” really put some wind in my sails.



My first week clean always is rough. Physically I will get shakes, nausea, dizziness, no appetite, and restlessly turn in my bed.  Mentally, I will have constant cravings, anxiety, jumbled thoughts, and irritability.  However, these are symptoms that will pass and I can sit out.  



What always derails the operation is the deep depression that slams me 2 weeks clean. I know that chemical traces are retained in your fat stores so my theory is that as I lose weight (no binge eating anymore) trace amounts of it are still trickling into my system and around the two week mark I metabolize the last of it. 



Well anyway, today marks day 2 of many more to come. Appreciate y'all reading this emotional word salad. Thank you fellow learners, any words of encouragement are appreciated.  I will be in the comments of y'all's future posts.

1jhzes7,leaves,2025-03-23 13:35:54,"11 Months Off Weed – Still Struggling with Anhedonia, Depression & Brain Fog. Anyone Else?","
Hey everyone,

I’ve been clean from cannabis for 11 months after 25 years of daily use. While quitting was the right decision, I’m still dealing with some frustrating symptoms:

Anhedonia – I struggle to feel joy or motivation. Things that used to excite me now feel dull.

Depression & Fatigue – I often feel unmotivated, lethargic, and just don’t have the drive to do things.

Brain Fog – My mind feels slow, like there’s a constant haze. My thoughts don’t flow like they used to.


I’ve tried various supplements, but what has helped me the most so far are exercise, structure, and forcing myself into action. Even when I don’t feel like doing something, I push through—especially with working out, engaging in hobbies, and socializing (even though it’s hard). I also focus on improving sleep and reducing stress.

Mornings are usually the worst, with intense overthinking and low energy. Evenings tend to be a little better.

I’m wondering if anyone else has experienced something similar after quitting long-term weed use? How long did it take for things to improve for you? Any tips on getting past this stage?

Would love to hear your experiences!

1jh1mnp,leaves,2025-03-22 05:41:36,One terrifying but utterly humbling moment of clarity.,"So I decided to go to a Karaoke Social night, to try to break out of my comfort zone, meet new people, expand my horizons...did I mention this was at a bar called Weary Livers that was basically the poster child for drinking till wasted and smoking absolute shitloads of marijuana?

Yeah it was looking remarkably and inexorably grim. I have been without a drop of Alcohol in 455 days, and no marijuana for 40 days, but here I was, telling myself I could go to that bar and stay sober, shaking as I drove over to Wasted Livers (shaking and trembling with passion as I write this, every bone marrow quivering in humility). Even worse I have had today such a sober, in the zone flow state, clear headed healthy and productive in the flow state all day long. And I was about to throw it all away yet again, for fucking nothing but to impress a bunch of drunk, stoned people who don't care for me, each other and who I probably don't even like.

Because I wanted to ""reward"" myself for securing the highest paying career of my life (start RBT just officially certified after four 1/2 years as a BHT and BT, nearly completely certified in Python and beginning C++ certification as well for designing a video game franchise 2 years in concept before execution due to being stillborn from drug misuse) by getting drunk and stoned.

How many times have I sold away my potential, my self-actualization to impress lower orders who never cared for me at all? Tens of thousands of times from 20 to late 34, when alcohol and drugs were my entire way of life. It was about getting high off the drugs, not meeting new people as it was in the beginning, the using became the focus of my social sphere.

Tonight was different, the second I walked into that bar, I thought to myself ""A drink would be nice because these people look empty to socialize with otherwise"" and I just turned around and hightailed it right the fuck out of there, got in my car sober and began to head home.

This wasn't my spiritual awakening oh FUCKING HELL NO, that came in 30 seconds in what I can only describe as divine providence in every possible conception of the word. I pull onto the 405, and within seconds of getting on the freeway, traffic slowed to a crawl and I literally drove straight towards a close up past with an extreme close up of a grizzly from the very bottom of hell DUI and covered in blood and shattered debris drunken driver, surrounded by very pissed off cops, a trail of crushed metal and swerving vehicles, and his car utterly capsized and smashed into a crushed cubicle.

I will NEVER nor not EVER forget the look of total, hatred, despair, rage, nihilistic depression and death I saw in his eyes, you could see his soul literally burning alive, covered in porous torrents of dripping fresh blood, ashed cigarettes everywhere, beer bottles all over the ripped and torn back seats.

I only felt pity and tremendous gratitude in this moment, because I knew God was giving me a massive kick in the pants tonight, in the greatest way imaginable to a man so acquainted with the dark side of life. He was showing me, ""This right here is what your life could have been tonight, and every night following, this is what you get to walk away from living again.""

It rocked my soul to its very core, trembling with peace and abundance. Don't make sobriety harder than it needs to ever be. If you want to go to a bar, crack house, junkshop, or a dispensary and want to stay sober (key component here) go with higher purpose and self actualized friends and lovers who care for your soul, nurture your spirit, eliven your flame, ignite your passion, and would rather take a bullet for you straight through the chest cavity., Then soley ressurect themselves just to take the next round, because with those quality of friends and lovers at your side, you cannot fail.

We commit the worst-acts of self destruction mostly to please people we don't care for or even like. And whom hate us in return. And its pathetic.

God shall ensure your soul remains forever baptized in the humbling spirit of transcended flesh and liberated bones to a dimension beyond happiness itself, so long as you remain true to yourself, your principles and your values and you play the tape in full, before your tape plays out.

TLDR:I did not drink or smoke marijuana tonight, but I put myself dangerously close. I told myself this was with sober eyes to see the old Addiction Gremlin for myself to test my commitment. God did the work for me with driving past such an ugly DUI driving sober back home, it is utterly humbling and cathartic, I got everything I needed and was looking for...by turning away from the car and walking away, I walked into exactly what I needed to see and feel within my soul.

And nothing could ever be more beautiful, authentic, humble, valuable, or real.

1j13hwm,leaves,2025-03-01 16:35:51,I have lost all my feelings,"Hi guys,

Chronic weed abuser here since I was 16.
I got sober at 33 and stayed like that for 252 days (I stopped counting the days at one point)
I got everything my heart desired, I am an artist's and wrote, recorded and released my album. I even created my t-shirts and sold them out.
I did my dream trip solo traveling in Costa Rica. I was living my best life.
But there I relapsed. One time I hit once at a beach party to be friendly. It didn't do anything for me...
But then a few weeks later on the other side of the country we where watching the sunset at a bar and a friend from my country who lives in Costa Rica pulled out a joint. Why would I say no now? I did it last week once and it was no problem. Safe to say this was different; the way he smoked was like I used too do it: weed + tobacco.

When I went back to my country during winter I fell in a depression. My girlfriend smoked too and I asked her for a joint. 
Ever since then things have been awful; this was 1 year and 3 months ago.

Everything feels like a blur, I am unenthusiastic and suicidal.
I tell my self it's not that expensive (50€ every 8-9 days) but I can't feel a thing anymore. My libido is horrendous while I used to be an animal. My spiritual forces are gone. I have had some horrible sensitive bowel issues. I barely still make music. Bought a expensive recording studio but have never used it.
I am rich as fuck but all I do is worry about stocks, getting hit by taxes and the economy.
I am in a job search program for 2 years now (got fired few months after I quit smoking in 2023) and it's just pathetic. I don't get any new jobs offers. They probably sense I don't want it and am depressed.

It is pathetic, I am suicidal, I feel only the negative and keep spiraling in it.


Please.
Just stop.
I have a little weed left that I will finish today. I am going on a family holiday for six days starting Tuesday, I will use that to quit.

Good luck. I know who I am and what I'm capable off. 

Don't touch weed. Nothing but a big black void of nothingness.

I have been extremely irritable, angry, anxious and depressed. I am craving weed so bad. I don’t know what to do with myself. I am so bored and lonely. 

Please tell me this gets easier. I am pretty depressed and feeling so hopeless right now. I have been trying to keep distracted and get some exercise during the day. But it’s so hard because I cannot focus or sit still at all. I have adhd and weed was really helping with that. But now that I’m not smoking I cannot sit still. I am very restless. I am suppose to be getting some help for this. I have an intake appointment to start this IOP therapy program but my appointment isn’t until next Friday. 

What helps with everyone’s withdraws? Especially the anxiety and depression part? This is almost unbearable. I am so uncomfortable. I have been so emotional. My intrusive and unpleasant thoughts have been very strong these past few days and the weed cravings are so bad and intense. Anyone have advice? Words of encouragement? 

For those who have gotten through the withdraws, how long did it take for the depression, anger and anxiety to settle down? Am I going to be depressed and anxious like this forever? Does this get easier? Please tell me this gets easier. Am I almost at the end of these withdraws? How much longer is this going to last? The physical withdraws have gotten a little better but I still feel pretty achy and I still am very shaky. I have been having a lot of panic attacks and meltdowns/mental breakdowns, especially at night. What helps you guys at night time? Night time is the worst time for me.

It occurred to me the other day that I was feeling grateful to be alive. Sounds ludicrous, knowing where I was only a few years ago. Maybe this won't last; but it's a nice feeling. So I wanted to tell somebody.

Life is still not easy. I am struggling about many things. I do get very sad. And I can't remember the last time I didn't feel lonely.

But it's... okay. Somehow, I'm still glad that I'm alive to feel these feelings. Anger, depression, frustration, sorrow, fear, all of it. I couldn't have known this about me had I had my way back then. I'm so thankful that I stuck around.

This might sound boring and unhelpful, but the older I get, I can see why the older people in my life kept trying to tell me that there was more to life. There really is; the living itself. And there are definitely wisdom that only age can give me.

1jly7d8,depression_help,2025-03-28 15:49:32,I got out of depression. If you're in it right now – you're not alone.,"For a long time, it felt like there was no way out. Every day looked the same as the one before, and inside, there was nothing but emptiness. Even when I tried to change something, it felt useless.

But one day, I realized: depression is not a life sentence. I started looking for real methods that actually work, not just the usual think positive, hit the gym, take a sedative, or try sleeping pills, melatonin etc. Step by step, by applying concrete actions, I made my way out.

Now, I see how many people feel the same way I did back then. And if you're in that darkness right now – know that there is a way out.

If you feel the same way, I can share my experience. Maybe what helped me will help you too.

1j0a3rc,depression_help,2025-02-28 15:21:23,My whole life is about to change and I can’t stop panicking.,"The landlord wants us out in 3 weeks. I applied for two apartments yesterday and am anxiously awaiting to hear back. I have two small kids, boy and girl and cannot afford more than a two bedroom but I would never ask them to give up their spaces so I will not have a bedroom anymore. I’m fine with it but I feel like a failure. 

I finally found a job and of course I start Monday. How am I going to work a new job, move to a new place and juggle two kids? (divorced 50/50 custody, I do not get child support either).

Also, I have been trying to leave my narcissist bf anyway and this is finally my opportunity and he is making it very difficult for me with his guilt and depression. He wanted to buy the house from the landlord but his credit score is really bad and I think he expected me to be a co-signer or to use my not much better credit score. But I didn’t offer and he didn’t ask so he wasn’t able to get the house(he was already living here when I moved in, I have no attachment or care for this house) and I feel his anger every time I talk to him (he’s out of town working right now). He totally resents me right now and will be passive aggressive on top of all of this and I’m too nice to say “fuck off you’re not moving with me!” I think he just assumes he is! 

I have used up almost all of my savings. My mom is dead, my dad barely talks to me and he has never helped me in anyway. I don’t have any family except my sister who lives in another state.

1j8pilh,depression_help,2025-03-11 12:26:01,My thoughts on ketamine treatment if anyone is interested,"As someone who has undergone ketamine infusions for depression treatment, I want to share my thoughts on the experience.

In the first few sessions—maybe the first six—ketamine made me feel like a child again, but only while it was in my system. Everything seemed interesting, and for a moment, it felt like my depression had disappeared. But once the effects wore off, the emptiness and dread came rushing back.

Ketamine does not address the root causes of depression. It only provides temporary relief from the pain. The more you take it, the less effective it becomes, requiring higher doses to achieve the same effects, which makes dependency a real risk.

What truly helped me overcome depression was facing it head-on. For me, this meant:

0. Ending a rough relationship to give myself space to heal.


1. Getting plenty of rest.


2. Finding and taking the right medication.


3. Working through trauma and pain by reframing my past, present, and future in a way that allowed me to see them in a more positive light.

What this meant for me that I realized that I had control over how I thought and felt about certain aspects of life, and shifting that perspective made a significant difference. I could decide for myself how to react to certain stimuli. For instance, when I encountered a what it thought was difficult (such as a notice from a bank), I asked myself, Why do I think this is difficult? Do I really need to stress about this? Over time, I realized that I had more control over my reactions than I had previously believed. 


Anyway. Just wanted to share my findings about this. Also my final advice to you. Don't give up. You are not garbage. You are just going though something. Remember to give yourself time to heal. If you don't have enough energy to take care of yourself perfectly, that's fine.

1j8suby,depression_help,2025-03-11 15:04:01,"No longer depressed, and realizing depression is the final gate before happiness","Felt the need to post here for some reason. Maybe someone needs this.

I only recently got out of a DV situation where I've been physically abused, manipulated, gaslighted, and couldn't discern truth from what was presented in front of me. After that, my life has been put on fast forward through all kinds of pain and suffering alone--stress, anxiety, identity crisis, loneliness, depression, and many other things. In the past 2-3 years, my life has drastically changed as a result of a lot of self-reflection and meditation/yoga, and now my past feels like a single star in a vast, night sky that I can look at whenever I need to.

As a barometer/checkpoint--depression, in video game terms, can be considered the final boss of mental illness. So if you're here, you've pretty much gone through everything else in life in terms of the creative ways you can mentally destroy yourself. The only step left to do is to cease this self-destruction.

The next phase in your life would be: can you truly handle not having any obligations? Can you truly and fully relax yourself and allow life to take you on its course? Nothing is expected of you and no one knows you better than you. Can you truly, genuinely, and authentically accept this mental reframing?

Life can be easy, effortless, and free, but you and I have been taught it's supposed to be difficult, contentious, and treacherous. I sat through over 90 days of painful meditation to accept this fact because I've been trained and brainwashed so finely into such a rut. But if sitting through 3 months of meditation undoes lifetimes of trauma and allows me to share this experience, I'll take it any day.

Couldn't post with a link (or with special symbols. This website is really making it inconvenient to provide help), so I'll put the video title in the comments, but I talk more about the mechanics of depression in an 8-minute video, which summarizes more of what I learned and maybe it will provide a perspective you haven't heard before.

This wasn't the first incidence, as I floated from community to community because of my behavior. Granted, some of these community didn't have the best people, but it didn't help my case to fight and challenge others when calling something out (eg: racism and transphobia). That hostility grew not only from self-hate but into vitriolic shaming of others. 

This entire past week, the depression and black pilling took tenfold and today it led to me being not only banned from a subreddit, but also muted by the mods when I reached out to them. I was even banned from their Discord as well. I'm not absolving myself of my actions, because I did those negative things, I refused to heal and mature and seek help, only instead to wallow, brood, and lash out.

There are days or weeks or even years where life feels great and it feels great to be alive but then it comes with these depressive periods as well. And its not cause of some life tragedy that occurs but that sense of depression and lack of meaning that hits you like waves.

Life isnt fantastic by any means but neither is it bad enough to be depressed and i dont know why it keeps happening. I'm sometimes worried that somewhere down the road, it might hit me hard enough that i might be suicidal. 

Whenever i see news of celebrities committing suicide, especially those at a much older age, i can empathize with them and somehow, i can imagine they must have had similar thoughts as me at my current age and im worried that i'd reach that age where id feel suicidal. 

On times/periods i feel good, i always get anxious on when the next depressive episode might occur. 

I've thought of getting professional help but knowing me, when things get good, id stop going. and the cycle repeats.

1jd7hk8,depression_help,2025-03-17 07:59:21,How I Healed Depression and Porn Addiction,"# From Rock Bottom to Renewal: My Journey Out of Depression

I am going to be respectful of the rules of this community, so I will only share parts of my journey that align with its values.

Most of us who are deep in depression aren’t even on Reddit. I know this because I was there. When you're overwhelmed by depression, you don’t always recognize it as ""depression."" You don’t have the energy to get up, ask for help, or even consider a healing journey.

I was addicted to porn from a very young age—my first exposure was at just seven years old. Depression followed me for most of my adult life. The best and worst thing that ever happened to me was losing everything. I lost 2.5 million Canadian dollars in the market, and after that, my sense of self didn’t even have money to keep itself alive.

I remember choosing the right bridge to jump off. But then, as if by some miracle, a van with a suicide hotline number printed on its side appeared outside my apartment. That moment changed everything. I called my dad and told him what had happened.

I get it—you've probably heard all the advice, all the motivational talks. I had too. But when I hit rock bottom, I had only two choices: die or change.

I went back to my homeland for a few months, but I couldn't get along with anyone. I didn’t like anyone at all. After my shoulder surgery (which I needed because of multiple seizures that repeatedly dislocated it), I returned to Canada for physiotherapy.

Then I made a decision. I packed my bags and left for Nepal. I stayed there for eight months—six of them in an ashram with a charlatan guru. After that, I spent a few more months in India. I learned a lot, but I still wasn’t healed.

Two books changed my perspective:

1. *The Alchemist*
2. *Man’s Search for Meaning*

Later, I traveled to Peru and learned from its indigenous people. By the end of my healing journey, I had become the person I never thought I could be—someone who now helps others overcome the same challenges I once faced.

Today, I live in Medellín, Colombia. If someone asked me how I cured my depression, I would say:

1. Two great books
2. A heavy dose of disillusionment
3. Embracing my own humanity
4. The wisdom and support of my friends in the Amazon

Cheers. I hope you receive the same love and support that I did. You deserve it.

1j892gk,depression_help,2025-03-10 20:51:13,"I know my habits are making my depression worse, but I can’t change them","I’ve been struggling with depression since I was about 10. Over the years, there have been times when it got easier—2023, in particular, felt like a turning point. For most of that year, I genuinely believed I had overcome it. While I had occasional low periods, they were rare compared to previous years.

2024 started off alright as well, but by late summer—around August or September—I found myself sinking back into depression. Now, I’m at one of my lowest points again, and it’s heartbreaking to feel like I was so close to happiness only to end up back here.

The frustrating part is that I can pinpoint a lot of the reasons why I feel this way. I rarely go outside, I don’t have a job or attend school, my relationship is struggling, I’ve lost important friends, my diet is poor, I started smoking, and I spend almost all day in bed. My screen time is through the roof, I consume media that reinforces my sadness, and my room is dark and messy. I know these things contribute to my depression—maybe even cause it—but I can’t seem to change them.

There have been moments when I felt motivated to turn things around, and for a while, it worked. But every time I try, I eventually fall back into an even darker place, and the cycle repeats. It’s not just the disappointment of failing that drags me down—it’s that the depression seems to return out of nowhere, even when I think I’m making progress. I’ll wake up one day and just feel awful for no reason.

I want to change, but even the simplest things—eating better, going outside, tidying up—feel impossible. On top of that, there’s a part of me that seems to be working against me, growing stronger the more I struggle. My emotions shift unpredictably; I’ll be okay for a couple of weeks, then suddenly crash into weeks of deep depression. It’s exhausting, and I don’t know what to do.

I wish I could just push myself to get a job or go to school, but my social anxiety makes that overwhelming, and I don’t have access to therapy.

I am American, and in this current political and economic sphere, things are going to get so much worse before they start to get better. I just feel so discouraged every single day. 

On top of that, day-to-day life feels like a dark tunnel with no light at the end. Every day is a fight that I have to conquer, yet I am so tired. And quite honestly, my 20s have been the worst years of my life.

1jgyn5i,depression_help,2025-03-22 02:45:07,"I Think I Ruined My Bond With My Sister, and It’s Breaking Me 💔","I don’t know if I’m being overprotective, controlling, or just a brother who cares too much. But I think I messed up, and now my sister is distancing herself from me.

I’m 24M, and my sister is 21F. We used to be really close, but things changed in the past few months. She had a 3-month relationship, and after the breakup, she started having anxiety attacks. I was the one who supported her, and she told me she wouldn't date again. But now, she’s secretly chatting with someone again.

She hides her chats, deletes messages, and acts differently when I’m around. I tried talking to her and told her that she’s free to do whatever she wants, but I don’t want her dating again, at least not now. I reminded her of her past experience, but she just said, “It’s my life, my choice.” That hit me hard.

But here’s the thing—I’m not innocent in all this. I used to be overly protective, and yeah, I even invaded her privacy. I kept an eye on her, checked who she was talking to, and I’ve even tried hacking into networks to see her messages (which didn’t work). I thought I was doing it to protect her, but now I see how it must have felt like I was spying on her.

Now, she’s avoiding me. Today, we were sitting with our relatives, and the moment they left the room, she left too—on purpose. She doesn’t even ask me simple things like what to bring from outside when my dad tells her to check with everyone.

What hurts me even more is that whenever I ask her ""When will we talk?"", she just says ""We'll see"" and avoids answering directly. No matter what I ask, her response is always ""We'll see."" It feels like she doesn’t care anymore, or maybe she’s waiting for me to stop asking.

And the worst part? She’s not forgiving me. I’ve apologized, I’ve tried to talk things out, but she straight-up told me to ""stay away"" for now. It’s like she wants nothing to do with me.

I don’t know if she’s just mad at me, or if I’ve permanently damaged our bond. I know I made mistakes, but I did it out of concern.

At the same time, I’m dealing with my own problems—career uncertainty, health issues, and depression since I was 18. Everything feels messed up. I even started smoking again from the stress.

I don’t know what to do. Should I distance myself? Apologize again? Or just let things be? I feel like I’ve lost my sister, and I don’t know how to fix it.

What are your tips for making chores and adulting as easy as possible? I live a very simple life already because it helps me mentally, but I know there are improvements and simplifications I can make that would make things just a little easier.

I have a full-time job and I've been with this company for almost 6 years. I barely make enough to survive. After bills are paid, there is NOTHING left. We get paid at the end of each month, on the 25th. By the 2nd, everything is gone. I have a flatmate who pays rent and that covers food for the month. Barely. Everyone keeps saying it will get better, that eventually I will get a raise or a proper increase. I've been hearing this for over 5 years but it's only gotten worse. I'm sick of hearing the same empty words over and over.

I have to retire in 25 years. I've done the math. I can afford to live for maybe 3 years after retirement. 

I can't struggle like this for the next 25 years. The stress is killing me. I honestly don't see the point of hanging around another 25 years.

If my parents weren't still alive, I would have unalived myself years ago. I have pets that are my reason to get up in the morning. When they pass, I won't get more pets. I don't want to leave them behind when I check out. 

I've been to therapy, I'm on meds. But that won't change my situation. I've been looking for a new job for over 4 years. I don't even get interviews.

I'm almost 100% sure that I am going to check out once my parents pass. I've even decided how I'll do it. I don't see a future for myself. I don't see relief, hope, light.

Here's some backstory.
About 12 years ago, her parents divorced due to her mother being abusive, and her father left to texas or somewhere around there. Her mother met this fat dude who isn't really fit to be a father. He always rants to mom about little things that my girlfriend did, and overall being a jackass. She has a brother and a sister but they are ignorant.

Her mother nowadays is still strict, and still gets mad at my girlfriend for not listening to her step dad. Because the step dad always rants to her about very small things and making it a big thing. This lead to depression for my girlfriend.

Another horrible thing that happened 5-7 years ago is that her step dad SA'd my girlfriend, but not full on r*pe. She has no evidence of this and she's become really suicidal about it. Even making threats to jump off a bridge. She can't tell her mother about it because her mother will think that she is ""crazy"" as her mother really also neglects her.

I really need help, I don't want her to double down on committing suicide. Please I need help.

1jahsh2,depression_help,2025-03-13 17:38:44,Is it still worth trying to fix your problems after 30?,"This is a bit negative so close the tab without reading any further if you're currently vulnerable to defeatism or hopelessness.

Is it worth the effort to try to fix your mental health problems after reaching the age of 30? What is the best possible life outcome you could still achieve at this stage?

* Your best years are already behind you. Whatever quality of life benefits you might obtain from this point onwards will be subject to age-based diminishing returns. Your windows for the best life experiences at the ideal formative times for growth, life milestones, and happy memories will have most likely passed.

* Access to social opportunities is very limited or nonexistent. The likelihood of making friends or being part of a social circle who care about you is slim to none. Whatever loneliness you have suffered, which has contributed to your depression, is unlikely to ever be resolved in the meaningful way you would have hoped for, i.e. by finding your place among people.

* Even if it were the case that social opportunities were readily available, by this point, you will have already realised that ""fitting in"" isn't worth it. By which I mean that your experience with poor mental health has a way of teaching you that the social groups formed by normal people aren't worth trying to belong to. The longer disordered mental health is left to fester, the more your exposure to this darker side of being, rejected by normal people out of a healthy sense of self-preservation, becomes an inextricable part of your identity. People can smell the stink of it on you a mile away, and you will be shunned, treated with hostility, or in the best-case scenario relegated to the bottom of the hierarchy and taken advantage of. You will never belong or attain the normal life you had hoped for. Happy, healthy, functional people have a zero tolerance policy for anything which might weaken the collective wellbeing of the group. And this is never more true than later in life, when the stakes are higher, and when people need to keep their shit together not just for themselves but for their families. They do not want to be weakened by the same void that has sucked the life out of you for so long.

* There is a danger of falling victim to the sunk cost fallacy. Investing time in trying to fix your problems, as opposed to distracting yourself from them, means opening oneself up to the experience of a more acute form of suffering vs less intense suffering. However, there is no guarantee of success in the endeavour. It could easily end up that you're 40 before you know it, no further ahead than you were in your 30s, still spinning your wheels trying to fix yourself, enduring an even greater suffering than you would be if you'd just half-heartedly played video games or watched TV for a decade. There is increased susceptibility to this phenomenon as a person senses their time running out, and as they become more and more desperate to find a resolution to the thing that has plagued them all their life before it ends.

Can anybody counterbalance this perspective with a more positive view or success story about fixing one's problems after 30?",5,14,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression_help/comments/1jahsh2/is_it_still_worth_trying_to_fix_your_problems/,still worth trying fix problems 30 bit negative close tab without reading youre currently vulnerable defeatism hopelessness worth effort try fix mental health problems reaching age 30 best possible life outcome could still achieve stage best years already behind Whatever quality life benefits might obtain point onwards subject agebased diminishing returns windows best life experiences ideal formative times growth life milestones happy memories likely passed Access social opportunities limited nonexistent likelihood making friends part social circle care slim none Whatever loneliness suffered contributed depression unlikely ever resolved meaningful way would hoped ie finding place among people Even case social opportunities readily available point already realised fitting isnt worth mean experience poor mental health way teaching social groups formed normal people arent worth trying belong longer disordered mental health left fester exposure darker side rejected normal people healthy sense selfpreservation becomes inextricable part identity People smell stink mile away shunned treated hostility bestcase scenario relegated bottom hierarchy taken advantage never belong attain normal life hoped Happy healthy functional people zero tolerance policy anything might weaken collective wellbeing group never true later life stakes higher people need keep shit together families want weakened void sucked life long danger falling victim sunk cost fallacy Investing time trying fix problems opposed distracting means opening oneself experience acute form suffering vs less intense suffering However guarantee success endeavour could easily end youre 40 know ahead 30s still spinning wheels trying fix enduring even greater suffering would youd halfheartedly played video games watched TV decade increased susceptibility phenomenon person senses time running become desperate find resolution thing plagued life ends anybody counterbalance perspective positive view success story fixing ones problems 30

1j28a4w,depression_help,2025-03-03 02:26:13,I realized I'll never have a good life ever again,"That sounds dramatic but...  in all honesty... it's likely true. 

I have been diagnosed with chemo brain and post concussive disorder as well as a likely case of chronic traumatic encephalopathy. A main feature of all this is a flat depression with periods of extremely severe depression. I'm resistant or intolerant to almost all medications and have been extremely resistant to talk therapy. 

When I was younger, probably my 20s to 30s, I had an okay life. I was financially comfortable and living in a city that I liked. I still struggled a lot with my mental health and what I now know is autism and PMDD, but I had hobbies, a small group of friends, and did things. 

Late 2018 that all changed when I was given a medication that gave me complete anterograde amnesia for two months. I ""woke up"" a different person. Someone who is sad and miserable most of the time, and someone who cannot feel lasting joy. 2020 hit, and dating a person who has autoimmune kidney disease, right as I was starting to get involved in life again... I had to give most things I loved up. We *had* to isolate as even a later variant of covid, one much less severe, took 5% of my partner's kidney function. They're now in stage 4. I personally was also pretty badly affected, coughing up blood and had a BO2 in the high 80s. 

December 1 2021 was probably the worst day of my life. I can't really talk about it. It involves losing a support animal in an extremely traumatic way. I woke up a few days ago with extremely bad flashbacks and all I can do in those moments is scream ""NO NO NO"" and ""I'm so sorry baby. I'm so so sorry. You didn't deserve that.""

About four head injuries later, I was diagnosed as a suspected case of chronic concussive encephalopathy. I've had over 20 concussions.

I've lost who I am, lost my ability to be physically active due to neuromuscular diseases and the risk of falling. I was a dancer at one time. I loved ballroom and raqs sharqi. I loved exploring the woods which is out of reach for me now as my balance is so bad. I was that kid whose mode of transport was cartwheels, and could get across the monkey bars in a second.

I really don't know how to cope anymore. I feel like instead of moving I'm organizing and getting rid of my things so it's easier for my family to sort through them.

And being disabled, and living off disability in our current economy is impossible. If I do one activity a week, that is my entire paycheck when factoring in rent. I don't drive, and probably couldn't at this point legally. Not that I could afford a car anyways...

I just wish Right to Die programs covered people of whom have no quality of life and haven't for almost a decade. Whose treatment teams have all but given up and look sad when I ask what my future looks like. 

I just needed to vent. I don't think anyone would have advice that didn't ring hollow. I think people who make it to the other side in my shoes is hero worship and doesn't reflect reality.

1ji7b0n,depression_help,2025-03-23 19:21:43,Anyone Know How To Start Recuperating From Long Periods of Depression?,"My first depression happened in about 2010. Since then I've had periods of severe depression, periods of light depression and periods where I wasn't depressed.

I think I'm currently in the longest unbroken period of depression though. Started in 2020 as severe depression, turned into light depression at the end of 2022, and then turned back into severe depression at the end of 2023 and has been severe ever since.

Anyway, I say all this because I've also recovered from depression several times now. But I feel like each time I've done it, it has been harder than before. Taken more effort and it has been harder to make that effort.

At this point, like 6 depressions in and after being consistently depressed for like 4 years, I feel like I literally just no longer have the energy to get out of it. A lot of the time I just feel like I can't do anything else except passively accept my circumstances. Because I no longer believe it can get better, and I just don't have the energy left to recover.

It's like periods of drought. You can store up water and food for when a drought hits. But each drought you have to use some. And if a lot of droughts happen one after the other or last very long, the storage spaces for the water and food are gonna be drained. And so how do you survive then? How do you recover?

I feel like I'm at that point nowadays. And I'm not sure how I can change it.

Is there anyone here who...

1. Knows what I'm describing and has experienced it?
2. Managed to get out of it and start rebuilding their life?

1jhnypp,depression_help,2025-03-23 01:21:54,How True Is It That Smoking Makes Depression Worse ?,"Been dealing with depression for like 8 yrs now and funny enough I started smoking around the same time I got diagnosed. For me, smoking’s always been an escape, just something to fill the void. At least it gives me that temporary chill, even if it’s all in my head. Can’t say the same for antidepressants tho. Those just slowed me down, made me gain weight, and honestly made shit worse.

Since this depressive episode been dragging on for years, feels like my brain’s fried. My mind’s always foggy, memory’s trash, and sometimes even forming a sentence feels like a damn struggle. I know depression itself can do that, but could smoking be making it worse? I read somewhere that it messes with o2 flow to the brain, weakens neurons, and slows down thinking, but no clue if that’s real or just more bs theories.

Tbh when it comes to mental health, I lost faith in docs and all that traditional treatment shit. My experience with antidepressants was a disaster, and at this point, I trust real ppl’s experiences way more than whatever new study they push every few months.

So how true is it that smoking actually makes depression symptoms worse, like brain fog and focus issues? Cuz if that’s legit, I might need to rethink some things. My life’s already a mess thanks to this busted brain, and I just wanna fix whatever I still can. Maybe someone else can get something outta this too.",4,14,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression_help/comments/1jhnypp/how_true_is_it_that_smoking_makes_depression_worse/,True Smoking Makes Depression Worse dealing depression like 8 yrs funny enough started smoking around time got diagnosed smokings always escape something fill void least gives temporary chill even head Cant say antidepressants tho slowed made gain weight honestly made shit worse Since depressive episode dragging years feels like brains fried minds always foggy memorys trash sometimes even forming sentence feels like damn struggle know depression could smoking making worse read somewhere messes o2 flow brain weakens neurons slows thinking clue thats real bs theories Tbh comes mental health lost faith docs traditional treatment shit experience antidepressants disaster point trust real ppls experiences way whatever new study push every months true smoking actually makes depression symptoms worse like brain fog focus issues Cuz thats legit might need rethink things lifes already mess thanks busted brain wan na fix whatever still Maybe someone else get something outta

1jh0mm5,depression_help,2025-03-22 04:37:06,Depressed boyfriend turned toxic and I need to know if its normal,"My boyfriend is battling depression. He has zero energy for any kind of social interaction. He doesn't want to work. Sleeps a lot. Is pushing me away when I want to help or stonewalling me.

His ex took him to court for a custody battle that is draining him emotionally and financially. She's forbidding him to see his kids. It's been difficult for him.

One thing about me and my bf, I've always told him he could be himself around me. No mask, no fakeness, just him communicating his feelings. 

Lately he's been toxic and projecting those emotions onto me.
The caring man he used to be is now rude to me.
Yesterday something happened and I called him. He told me to let him know the outcome of my misadventures the next day, that's today.

I texted him, asking if he was free for a call so I call and tell him what happened. He replied: Do I really give off the vibe right now that I want to talk with you? That's a serious question. I didn't reply.

Last week, we were talking and he was his usual sweet man. He told me he couldn't wait to see me. Said I love you. Really made me feel better.

Earlier this week I asked him what he wanted to do, he got upset saying he didn't remember saying we should hang out and told me I was making him feel crazy.
But two hours later he apologized, saying work is stressful and he's gonna make time for me.

When I was over to his place, he was sweet for an hour and then he out of nowhere started an argument about plans we made and he called me toxic for reminding him of the conversation we had. Asked me why I was at his house to spend time with him. 

Sometimes I will ask him what he's up to at night and he'll say things like: Being extremely uninterested in having a conversation.
Or Why are you trying to force a conversation?

Before being depressed he was never this rude to me. Ever.

Tonight, in the span on 5 mins, he told me he didn't wanna talk to me. When I didn't reply he went hello???? And 3 mins later: Amazing communication! This is why I push you away!!


I've been depressed myself before but I never projected my emotions like that or turned mean towards the person I love the most.

What's going on, why is he like that now?

1jerx09,depression_help,2025-03-19 07:59:13,It’s me again. I rly need help.,"Hello everyone,

I am going through a very difficult period in my life again. I no longer know exactly who I am or what I can do.

I am an 18-year-old male, currently in higher education. I wake up early every day to return late in the evening. I am preparing for my driving license. I have someone in my life. I live with my grandparents. And each day can be quite good or feel like total hell.

Recently, I have seriously thought about committing suicide in different ways. I feel like I want to escape my life at all costs. I feel sick and weak every day.

Lately, I have started to feel strange sensations that deeply disturb me. I am someone who does not believe in God, who believes in nothing except science. Nevertheless, I feel like something evil is within me. Something that terrifies me, something that imposes dark thoughts on me, something that causes panic attacks.

I no longer know what to think about all this. And I am not taking drugs at the moment, because yes, I am strongly considering it.

Recently, I have started hearing a very stressful rhythm in my head. Very stressful. And it occurs randomly, like my panic attacks and dark thoughts. A headache also overwhelms me very intensely during these moments. And I am very afraid of it.

I feel like I am harming everyone who comes close to my circle. I sometimes think I deserve to be hated by these people, and I sincerely hope, deep down, that they are better off, away from the terrible person I can be.

I am tired. I have no answers; going to school has become hard to bear.

And if you are reading this message, don’t think about me anymore, block me, don’t meddle in my life, you don’t deserve this. Fly away from me, leave me where I must heal or let myself die.

You may be tired of fighting, feeling misunderstood, or carrying this silent pain inside you. Maybe you tried to explain how you feel, but the people around you didn't understand. Or maybe you've learned to hide your pain so well that no one notices how much you're hurting.  

But please don't let this darkness convince you that you are alone or that there is no way out. Depression distorts reality, makes it seem like nothing will ever get better, that no one cares, that you will never be enough. But that's not true.  

You don't need to solve everything at once. Just do what you can today, even if it's something small like drinking a glass of water or getting out of bed for a few minutes.

1jb4102,depression_help,2025-03-14 13:34:29,How to get over the girl that I love more than anything who doesn’t speak to me anymore,"I’ve been struggling with depression for a while, but everything got worse when the foreign exchange girl I was dating went back home to Europe. She was my first real love, and being with her felt like the only time I was truly happy. I spent months thinking about her, wanting to be with her, and when I finally got the chance, it was everything I wanted—until it wasn’t. When she went home, she ghosted me and immediately got back together with the boy in Italy that she was talking to/dating before she came to America. Ever since she left, the world hasn’t felt the same. 

I don’t find joy in anything anymore and I want to be dead. I stay inside all day, playing video games just to pass the time. I barely talk to my friends because I don’t want them to see how bad things have gotten. My family tries to help, but I feel disconnected from them and in a way I resent them because they’re the only reason I haven’t killed myself.

I don’t know how to move forward because I don’t want to move forward. I need closure. I need to know the true reason she didn’t stay in touch. She was everything to me and then I find out that I didn’t matter that much to her hurts me so bad. She was always gonna go back home to him, I knew that when we started dating, but she told me that what they had wasn’t a big deal and that she wanted to be with me.

She used to own her business, worked making 6figures, now she lives in poverty, hardly ever leaving her apartment. It’s been one loss after another and it’s all taken a toll on her. 
15 years ago, as I said she was working, had a house and money. She got screwed over by her then business partner and that started this whole story. She had to sell her house to pay for lawyers, court fees to try and win her business back but after years ended up running out of money and lost it all anyways. She used ALL of the money from the sale of her house/businesses and now has nothing. Her husband left her about 8 years ago and she was still doing alright kind of bouncing around from low wage jobs and apartments but finally decided she couldn’t work anymore due to medical issues and had to move in with me. 
It started out okay, she would come stay with me and my family, helping by babysitting, cleaning, etc. and in return she’d get a free place to live and eat. We didn’t charge her for anything. It worked out okay for a while until she slowly started retreating into her room more and sleeping half the day away. She started missing her babysitting time making me late for work. I struggled waking her up for my 1pm work time which seemed crazy to my husband and I. We finally decided if she couldn’t do the little we were asking of her then she had to find her own apartment near by so we could still be close enough to help her. When she moved out she said she felt better having her own space again but her depression just got worse. She started never leaving unless I went and physically got her up and out. Now I’m the only person she has, everyone else has been alienated and she just sleeps all day and by 6pm when she gets up, she calls me for food and I always deliver. My husband thinks she’s taking advantage of me but if I don’t do it, nobody else will and she will literally be on her own and I’m not sure she will take care of herself enough to survive. We’ve fought over her being depressed so many times but she always swears she’s “fine” and she just enjoys sleeping in and staying in her house. But I just can’t believe that. Elderly people who recluse themselves and experience loneliness are so much more likely to die and I don’t want to lose her. I can’t convince her to get help and I don’t know what to do. Just venting feels better but it doesn’t solve my problem.

I’m a transgender man from Russia. Currently I am in Georgia(the country). 
Me and my family moved from there, because they banned all forms of gender transitioning and because of the war. 
A couple of months later, after we came here, Georgia adopted the same laws. 
Gladly, I am able to buy my medication. For now. 
A half a year ago me and my family got in touch with an organisation that was supposed to help us with our visas, they said they’ll try to help us to get humanitarian visas to France. It’s been a half of year, and we haven’t gotten a response from the French embassy yet. The organisation we’re in touch with says that everything’s alright and that we should just wait. However, I suspect we will never get a response, since me and my family are not related by blood - only by time and by care for each other.  
I feel like I’m never gonna be in a place where I’d be able to finally stop running away. 
 
Anything but a humanitarian  visa is not an option for us, since there’s four people and getting regular kinda of visas will be financially impossible. 

I come from a broken household, and have a history of being physically abused as a kid, which, of course fucked me up a bit too. 

I was recovering and looking forward to the future before all of that have started. 

Now I don’t even brush my teeth anymore. I don’t go outside, because I get harassed every time I do, because I have a very unusual appearance for Georgia. I get easily irritated. I get easily upset. I think about killing my self a lot. I dream of starting to cut myself again. The only reason Im trying to fight it is my family and my love for them. 

People either say I should go to therapy or that it will get better with age. Therapy is expensive and I value having a roof over our heads much more that that. As for the age - me aging won’t stop people from harassing me just because of how I look, it won’t stop the world from spinning in the worst direction. I know these people are just either trying to help or being very polite, but it just feels like talking down.

My parents are so supportive and have told me it does not matter if I fail but I can’t help but still panic and worry and if I do I don’t want to have to re sit or think about my next options.

1j4570w,depression_help,2025-03-05 15:09:12,Hello everyone,"# Hey everyone,

I’m from Hungary, and English isn’t my first language, so sorry for any mistakes.

I’ve been struggling with anxiety and depression since I was 14. That’s when everything started to change for me. I want to share my story because I feel like I’ve been carrying this burden alone for too long, and I just want to see if anyone else has been through something similar.

When I started middle school, I had to go to a camp before classes began. It was supposed to be a fun way to meet new classmates, but for me, it was the opposite. I felt completely alone. I couldn’t make any friends, and at night, I cried in my bed, not wanting to talk to anyone. I even stayed awake just to avoid socializing.

The worst moment was when, at the end of the camp, everyone signed each other’s white shirts as a memory. When I looked at mine, I saw it was completely empty. Nobody had written anything. It might sound small, but for me, it was devastating. I realized then that I didn’t belong there. I left that school before I even started.

Since then, I’ve been struggling with social anxiety. I switched schools again and again, hoping it would get better, but it never did. I was always the quiet, anxious kid who couldn’t connect with anyone. I started therapy when I was 15 or 16, but nothing really changed.

I have never been in a relationship. In elementary school, I used to be popular, confident, and social. But suddenly, everything changed. No one ever showed interest in me, and whenever I tried, my fear and lack of confidence ruined everything. Girls lost interest before anything could even start.

I managed to graduate despite all the struggles, but those four years felt like the worst of my life. To cope, I started using snus, drinking energy drinks excessively, and eventually, I turned to weed. I even experimented with MDMA and other things just to feel something different—just to be happy for a little while.

After school, I started working at an airport. In some ways, it became my comfort zone, even though the job was stressful. But my anxiety never left me. I became addicted to snus and weed—they were my only relief after each exhausting day.

I’ve been dealing with these feelings for eight years now. I tried everything—therapy, medication, antidepressants. First, I got one for regular depression, but it didn’t work. Then I was diagnosed with bipolar depression and given another medication. I’ve been on it ever since, but I don’t feel like it’s helping. I also take medication for anxiety, which works temporarily, but I don’t want to become dependent on it.

I’ve had suicidal thoughts many times. I feel like I’ve completely lost myself. I don’t know who I am anymore. Every day feels harder than the last, and I’m scared that one day, these thoughts will win.

I’m not writing this to ask for sympathy. I just want to know if anyone else has been through something similar. Have you ever felt this lost? Have you ever felt like nothing helps?

I feel completely alone. I’ve never had close friends. Maybe it’s my fault, maybe it’s not. But I don’t know how to keep going anymore.

If you’ve read this far, thank you. And if you’re struggling too, I truly hope you find a way forward. Maybe our destiny is brighter than we think.",3,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression_help/comments/1j4570w/hello_everyone/,Hello everyone Hey everyone Im Hungary English isnt first language sorry mistakes Ive struggling anxiety depression since 14 Thats everything started change want share story feel like Ive carrying burden alone long want see anyone else something similar started middle school go camp classes began supposed fun way meet new classmates opposite felt completely alone couldnt make friends night cried bed wanting talk anyone even stayed awake avoid socializing worst moment end camp everyone signed others white shirts memory looked mine saw completely empty Nobody written anything might sound small devastating realized didnt belong left school even started Since Ive struggling social anxiety switched schools hoping would get better never always quiet anxious kid couldnt connect anyone started therapy 15 16 nothing really changed never relationship elementary school used popular confident social suddenly everything changed one ever showed interest whenever tried fear lack confidence ruined everything Girls lost interest anything could even start managed graduate despite struggles four years felt like worst life cope started using snus drinking energy drinks excessively eventually turned weed even experimented MDMA things feel something differentjust happy little school started working airport ways became comfort zone even though job stressful anxiety never left became addicted snus weedthey relief exhausting day Ive dealing feelings eight years tried everythingtherapy medication antidepressants First got one regular depression didnt work diagnosed bipolar depression given another medication Ive ever since dont feel like helping also take medication anxiety works temporarily dont want become dependent Ive suicidal thoughts many times feel like Ive completely lost dont know anymore Every day feels harder last Im scared one day thoughts win Im writing ask sympathy want know anyone else something similar ever felt lost ever felt like nothing helps feel completely alone Ive never close friends Maybe fault maybe dont know keep going anymore youve read far thank youre struggling truly hope find way forward Maybe destiny brighter think

I'm mourning the person I could have been. All I ever wanted was no less than to make the world a better place. I did chairity work, I did politics, I did stand up for people who couldn't do it themselves. I did everything I could so people around me would feel safe and appreciated. 

And now I can't do the easiest things. I used to love learning at school. Now I can't even open my books. I had so much hobbies and interests, now nothing brings me joy. Not even a little bit. Everything's requires so much energy. Being awake is exhausting. It feels like I am trying to run underwater. Every step is so fucking hard, there is so much resistance.

I can't imagine living the rest of my life under this conditions. I just can't. I want it so bad to get better and to stop. I don't want to be constantly happy, I just want this dark cloud around me to disappear.

The wort part is, I can't really describe it. Family and friends are trying to help, but the don't really understand. And beeping high functioning makes it harder for them to know when I am having a bad episode. I try to open up and reach for help, but then I have to explain it to them and what's even wors I hate seeing my family and friends being worried. 

I just want it to get better. I'm an medication and in therapy. It's just not working.

1j0e7or,depression_help,2025-02-28 18:10:46,Depression after a breakup.,"It's been real tough for me lately. 

I was in my first relationship this year, in the summer. It only lasted 3 months. But I absolutely adored him whilst it lasted. He ended it because he said he ""lost"" the romantic connection. What hurt me most is that he insisted that he wanted me in his life as a friend and of course that ended up being a load of bullshit. 

I'm over the breakup but it's triggered a major abandonment wound and it's made me completely spiral. I've been up and down the past 7 months. Sometimes I feel like I've be getting over it then boom, it's back. 

I've been waking up late, 1-2pm. I do nothing all day, barely go out. I hate it. Especially these past few days, they've been the worst. I followed him back for some bizarre reason a few days ago and it made me so emotionally sick. I unfollowed a day or so after. 

I feel so unloved, neglected, tired, I don't see the point in anything right now. I'm tired. I just want to feel any sense of joy. I've been thinking for a few years that I might have bpd of some kind, or cptsd, I'm not sure. 

I know I'll feel better soon, but it doesn't change how rotten these current moments feel.

1jm09t7,depression_help,2025-03-28 17:17:24,I resent this existence and don't want to play on it's terms. I want to continually acknowledge how shitty it is. Too tired/afraid to slog through consistent effort needed to change.,"I have to go to fucking technical-training for my trade in 2 weeks. Sunk money into this trash. I'm solely pursuing the trade for reliable wage. I don't select jobs based on whether I would like them. I've had about 15 jobs and detested all of them. I don't think any activity that is enforced for a minimum of 40 hours a week, at the exact time the employer tells you to, would ever be enjoyable, even if it consisted of staring at rainbows. I don't enjoy obligations. I have felt like I am going to snap and walk out at my stupid job for the past month. I don't know how I keep going. I am to lzy and afraid to die. If I had some pentobarbital I might do it, but getting that is to hard. I don't want to do anything, I resent my desires. I don't want to leave my comfort zone, I want to be content, but Im a shitty evolved creature that is meant to strive, find the end of a desire, then strive for the next one: ""satisfaction is just around the corner!"". Each year gets more godawful. I've had 5 therapists, 2 psychologists. My therapist gives me these corny ass ""self-love quotes"" to journal about, and I do it, because I am that desperate. I'm desperate, but doomed. I feel like a ticking time-bomb, full of bitterness, envy, and hate. It's all on the inside. I am fake because I am a fucking coward. I'm terrified of people. I am terrified of women even though I am 28. I will probably die a virgin. I think I have some kind of narcissism so I think I am just doomed anyways. I really really really really fucking HATE the idea that anything is my fault. For short periods of time I have been able to ""take responsibility"" for my life, and work toward some goal, but it always dissolves into crap. I took on-board the idea of determinism and no free-will about a decade ago, and it really meshes with this sense of faultlessness I have, so I really don't think it will change. I basically tried to kill myself about 4 years ago, but failed because I impulsively drank a 24-pack before, and then I ended up fleeing from the cops in my car and crashing. Psychiatrist said I have ""cluster-B"" symptoms, which means ""you are fucked"". Deep down, I don't really want to change. Everything feels correct and right, my depression feels logical and deserved, I pity myself, and this shitty fucking world is the real problem. When I hear ""only you can help yourself"" I feel this instinctual rage and hatred toward the person. I don't beleive I can fucking help myself, and it only reminds me of that. I mean I have been miserable for like 14 years and never made a substantial or lasting change. I am going to be thirty, and I dont care what you think, that is a bleak and depressing fact. My youth has basically gone down the shitter and I am jjust trying to salvage some remains at this point. As I write this I notice that I actually want to convince you that all of this is ture, I don't think I actually even watn to ""get better"". I love doing this, ranting about my life. I want pity, I want someone to tell me ""give up lazy bitch"". If you knew me, you would know I was a spoiled selfish piece of shit, and I guess you would be right, but I don't care.

1jliddd,depression_help,2025-03-28 00:27:38,Looking for some words of support please.,"I'm 37 years old and for many years i deal with depression, I didn't have a job, I was living alone and didn't want to see anybody, I was like that for aprox 10 years, years that I didn't make any progress for my life, suddenly like 3 years ago the only person I have a relationship Ghost me, didn't blame her tough, but something make me feel that I could hurt myself if I didn't change things, so I did, I look for a therapist myself, this time there wasn't anyone telling me to look for one it was me, and after a couple months my therapist told me that I should also look for a psychologist and get medicated, I also start a low level job in a call center, it wasn't much but it was something and I was working, something that I never did for many years and I felt, well better, no happy, but better.

A year and a half past and I was a very different person, I had a job change for the better, it's still a entry level job but it is in a law firm and I like working there, I'm hitting the gym almost daily, and I feel that things are improving.

Then a couple months ago I receive a text from a Ex girlfriend from before I was in the depression time, she and I part ways sometime before I fell to that bad place in my mind, truth be told part of the breakup with her was that, she saw me getting worse month by month and at the end I decided to break up, I know I wasn't making her happy.  And a couple months ago she text me, she said she was remembering me, and we start seeing each other, we hook up, she said she always love me, that she was gonna love me for the rest of her life, and I, I love her too, a lot, I smile so much every time I see her, I was happy beyond belief, I though this was my happy ending.

But of course, life is not like that, she has a life too, she is married for about 10 years, no kids though, but she said her husband is a good person and he hasn't do anything bad to her ever. So I get desperate and told her that I want to be with her completely, that if she is gonna leave him and we are gonna start something good, because that's what I wanted, we have this fight like 3 times, third time she tells me that no, she is not gonna leave him, that was monday, and she kinda cut communication with me, but told me we are gonna see us this Friday, but apart from that she doesn't reply to my messages or calls.

And now I'm here, feeling like shit, crying, begging, with fear of ending in a bad place again, I'm not going to the gym, not leaving my house, and im behind in my work because I'm not doing the things I should be doing, I really thought she was the happyness life was preparing for me, I see her and I think she is beautiful and funny and sparkling I don't know, she was that part that is still missing in my life, and I'm here now, desperate, with a pain in the chest, cannot stop crying, and in my bed, I love her and I'm not gonna be with her, I didn't want to be the guy she is cheating with, I want something more with her, a life, and now I don't have anything, tomorrow she is gonna see me only to say goodbye I know, I hate myself for being weak, I hate myself for feeling like this again, and I don't know what to do to put myself together again.",3,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression_help/comments/1jliddd/looking_for_some_words_of_support_please/,Looking words support please Im 37 years old many years deal depression didnt job living alone didnt want see anybody like aprox 10 years years didnt make progress life suddenly like 3 years ago person relationship Ghost didnt blame tough something make feel could hurt didnt change things look therapist time wasnt anyone telling look one couple months therapist told also look psychologist get medicated also start low level job call center wasnt much something working something never many years felt well better happy better year half past different person job change better still entry level job law firm like working Im hitting gym almost daily feel things improving couple months ago receive text Ex girlfriend depression time part ways sometime fell bad place mind truth told part breakup saw getting worse month month end decided break know wasnt making happy couple months ago text said remembering start seeing hook said always love gon na love rest life love lot smile much every time see happy beyond belief though happy ending course life like life married 10 years kids though said husband good person hasnt anything bad ever get desperate told want completely gon na leave gon na start something good thats wanted fight like 3 times third time tells gon na leave monday kinda cut communication told gon na see us Friday apart doesnt reply messages calls Im feeling like shit crying begging fear ending bad place Im going gym leaving house im behind work Im things really thought happyness life preparing see think beautiful funny sparkling dont know part still missing life Im desperate pain chest stop crying bed love Im gon na didnt want guy cheating want something life dont anything tomorrow gon na see say goodbye know hate weak hate feeling like dont know put together

1jjfrh6,depression_help,2025-03-25 09:57:09,Depressed boyfriend,"Hi everyone,
I’m really struggling right now and would appreciate any support or advice.

My boyfriend (6 months together) has been showing signs of depression for a while. He’s also grieving the loss of his best friend, which hit him very hard. In the beginning, our relationship was full of love, affection, and emotional closeness. He often told me how safe he felt with me, how much I meant to him, and how I helped him feel better — even during hard moments.

Over the past few weeks, he started pulling away. He was more distant, less responsive, sometimes affectionate, but also cold or flat. It felt very confusing. He told me he was “acting weird” and I could feel his guilt — like he knew he was hurting me but didn’t know how to stop it.

Now, for the past few days, he’s gone completely silent. He read my last message (which was kind and gentle), but hasn’t responded. He asked me before to stop messaging, and I respected that, but I’m scared. I don’t want him to feel like I’m abandoning him, especially now.

I know he’s not well. I know he probably misses me too — he just doesn’t know how to handle love right now. I just don’t know what to do. Should I keep giving him space? Should I check in? I’m not angry, I just don’t want him to feel alone.

Any thoughts or similar experiences would really help. Thank you so much.",3,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression_help/comments/1jjfrh6/depressed_boyfriend/,Depressed boyfriend Hi everyone Im really struggling right would appreciate support advice boyfriend 6 months together showing signs depression Hes also grieving loss best friend hit hard beginning relationship full love affection emotional closeness often told safe felt much meant helped feel better even hard moments past weeks started pulling away distant less responsive sometimes affectionate also cold flat felt confusing told acting weird could feel guilt like knew hurting didnt know stop past days hes gone completely silent read last message kind gentle hasnt responded asked stop messaging respected Im scared dont want feel like Im abandoning especially know hes well know probably misses doesnt know handle love right dont know keep giving space check Im angry dont want feel alone thoughts similar experiences would really help Thank much
1jjb8zp,depression_help,2025-03-25 04:25:28,Depressed BF wants to break up with me. Says I contribute to his bad mental health.,"My bf of a year is going through hell at the moment. Without being too personal, his ex wife is making his life hell, work doesn't pay well and his manager is on his case all the time, grief, car problems, financial problems, health problems. It doesn't end.  
He's told me he's severely depressed.  
I've tried to be a supportive partner but he needs a lot of space. He's irritable, snappy, short. Has no desire to do anything. When I talk to him, or try to, it always turn into some kind of fight. Or he will say he doesn't have the patience for it.

The past few days have been really rough for him. His ex wife forbid him from seeing his children and he spiralled.  
I talked to him, and he told me he wasn't in the mood to talk to anyone. So I gave him the space he asked for.  
Two days later I reconnected with him. He spiralled and accused me of giving him the silent treatment. I explained that it wasn't the case and he accused me of gas-lighting him.  
During the day, he started multiple micro fights over anything and everything. Everything I said, turned into a mini fight.  
Responding, another mini fight. I felt like I couldn't win no matter what I did or say. At the end of the day, he told me I wasn't taking accountability and he felt like I wasn't listening to him.

So I stopped answering to his messages, I was drained. He showed up at my apartment that night and he apologized. Held me and he cried. We talked and we decided to stay together.

After that day, he said he wasn't sure about us anymore. That I wasn't a good partner. 

When we started dating, he told me he's the kind of person to self sabotage and that if our relationship were to turn to shit, it would be his fault.

I can tell right now he's in self sabotage mode. Pushing people away. Especially me who is the closest to him.

I can also tell he's spiralling and want to be loved. But that I'm doing is contributing to his depression.  
Tonight he told me he wasn't sure if we should be together. That if I don't take accountability, he doesn't wanna talk to me anymore.",3,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression_help/comments/1jjb8zp/depressed_bf_wants_to_break_up_with_me_says_i/,Depressed BF wants break Says contribute bad mental health bf year going hell moment Without personal ex wife making life hell work doesnt pay well manager case time grief car problems financial problems health problems doesnt end Hes told hes severely depressed Ive tried supportive partner needs lot space Hes irritable snappy short desire anything talk try always turn kind fight say doesnt patience past days really rough ex wife forbid seeing children spiralled talked told wasnt mood talk anyone gave space asked Two days later reconnected spiralled accused giving silent treatment explained wasnt case accused gaslighting day started multiple micro fights anything everything Everything said turned mini fight Responding another mini fight felt like couldnt win matter say end day told wasnt taking accountability felt like wasnt listening stopped answering messages drained showed apartment night apologized Held cried talked decided stay together day said wasnt sure us anymore wasnt good partner started dating told hes kind person self sabotage relationship turn shit would fault tell right hes self sabotage mode Pushing people away Especially closest also tell hes spiralling want loved Im contributing depression Tonight told wasnt sure together dont take accountability doesnt wan na talk anymore
1jie8dd,depression_help,2025-03-24 00:29:30,Am I really depressed or just being lazy and exaggerative?,"I don't know if this is the right sub to go to but at this point I don't have many options. 

I have been feeling being ""depressed"" lately. When I say lately I mean for a couple of months I think. I've lost track of it. I think my situation is sort of uncommon. As of writting this, I am in my first year of college and still live with my parents. However, my parents are ""seperated"" (not divorced, they never married) and we still live in the same household along with my 2 sisters. One is in 5th grade and the other is in special education 3rd grade. Everyday is full of stress, as my father every now and then ignores my mother in matters for my sister. Also, he has put my mother in over thousands of dollars in financial debt because he stole her information to open credit cards. Recently, the court agreed that my mother has weekdays and my father has weekends. My father is out of the state for 3 weeks straight for his work and has put the stress of taking care of my sisters on my mother and I. Keep in mind, she does not have a job due to her taking care of my sisters and dropping me off to college. (My dad has done many other things to my mom, but that would be 2 paragraphs on its own)

I can't do this anymore, it been since my birth they were together, not together, together, and not together again. I feel like a burden, I don't take care of my hygene as often anymore, my college work is falling behind, I can't keep up with my room, I haven't changed my bedsheets in months, I haven't brushed in weeks, I eat like I am starving, then I eat like I'm full all the time, I hate that I talk to my mom like my dad, I hate I don't wake up on time for college which makes my mom late for her classes, I don't help around the house because my bum ass is lazy, my sleep schedule is abismal. I feel like nothing is real, but maybe because I don't get much sleep.

Yes, I have been thinking about SH, and its very vivid. With the amount of stress my mom deals with, I don't want to talk about this with her. And if I tell a professional about this, they might admit me to somewhere and get my mom and I into more debt and I fall behind more on other things. However, because of this she gives me talks about how im lazy and need to treat my college like a job and ""no wonder you're failing math with the amount you sleep like that."" She says these types of things alot, and I think she might be right. Maybe I am just lazy, maybe I am taking it too far and its just a ""cop out"" to stop doing my responsibilties. Another reason I think im just being lazy is that when I'm at campus, I am the opposite of this. I am friendly and chill, I laugh and have a good time. I still love to play videogames as its one of the few things that still give me joy. Am I just pretending? Am I not depressed becuase I am a bit self aware and still have hobbies?

1jdpryl,depression_help,2025-03-17 22:28:31,My life is hell,"I am a 24 year old man. I suffer from severe depression, fatigue, severe anxiety, ADHD, OCD and am currently burned out.

First of all, I don't have anywhere where I feel good. If I'm not at my parents' house, I feel alone, and I'm not liked by my roommates because I don't have the codes of how to run a house.

When I'm at my mother's house, I'm harassed, she blames me for my so-called lack of effort all day, the fact that I don't work (and yet I would like so much!!), blackmails me, puts psychological pressure on me, etc. No matter how much I tell her that depression is a real illness, she doesn't listen to me. Also, I don't have a bedroom and I sleep in the living room. I am not intimidated and am always bothered.

Then as soon as I wake up, after 12 hours of sleep, I feel terrible, depressed and tired. I have 0 motivations for the day, even things that previously motivated me like dancing motivate me more and in any case I am too tired to take transport.

So I spend all day doing nothing and feeling bad. Nothing motivates me and I'm too exhausted to go out etc. I can barely cook, just boil rice.

And in the evening my mother comes back with her reproaches etc.

This every day without knowing when it will get better. Medication doesn't work, neither does therapy.

Every day I try to force myself immensely to take a small step forward (today I ordered a food supplement against depression).

But it’s super long and overall I’m not making progress.

I have some assets in life but they are of no use to me. I like the girls but I don't want to inflict on them a boyfriend who is doing so badly (already tested, I got dumped for that) so I refuse their advances. I am good at studying but I cannot do it currently or with great difficulty (depression, burn-out, anxiety, fatigue, etc.). I have some savings but it's no use to me since I don't want to do anything and I can't travel. 

I've been stuck in this severe depression for 6 years, I have almost no friends left and I'm too depressed or tired to talk to them anyway.

I'm just surviving so as not to inflict my death on my little brother but I don't know how long I'll last..:",3,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression_help/comments/1jdpryl/my_life_is_hell/,life hell 24 year old man suffer severe depression fatigue severe anxiety ADHD OCD currently burned First dont anywhere feel good Im parents house feel alone Im liked roommates dont codes run house Im mothers house Im harassed blames socalled lack effort day fact dont work yet would like much blackmails puts psychological pressure etc matter much tell depression real illness doesnt listen Also dont bedroom sleep living room intimidated always bothered soon wake 12 hours sleep feel terrible depressed tired 0 motivations day even things previously motivated like dancing motivate case tired take transport spend day nothing feeling bad Nothing motivates Im exhausted go etc barely cook boil rice evening mother comes back reproaches etc every day without knowing get better Medication doesnt work neither therapy Every day try force immensely take small step forward today ordered food supplement depression super long overall Im making progress assets life use like girls dont want inflict boyfriend badly already tested got dumped refuse advances good studying currently great difficulty depression burnout anxiety fatigue etc savings use since dont want anything cant travel Ive stuck severe depression 6 years almost friends left Im depressed tired talk anyway Im surviving inflict death little brother dont know long Ill last

So cozy! Basically, everything is my speed in winter. I really struggle in summer or visiting places closer to the equator because it's the reverse: everyone's go go go all the time and I can't stand the sun and heat. All I want to do is lie down in a dark room and read a book or sleep, which people for some reason can't fathom outside of fall or winter. It makes me feel like I'm moving in slow motion compared to everyone else.

I think a lot of this has to do with my depression. I've struggled with it my whole life (I'm 23) and while I'm at the point where it's manageable, I dread summer every year for the above reasons. Neither my depression nor summer is going to go away (and with climate change, it'll just get more intense no matter where I live), so I want to figure out how to cope if I can't kick it entirely.

1ja69jx,depression_help,2025-03-13 07:06:50,Looking for reassurance/success stories,"(Trigger Warning) sensitive topics. 


Hi, so I’ve dealt with anxiety/ depression on and off (anxiety constantly, depression sometimes, I’ve been diagnosed with OCD recently (last couple years) /anxiety and the depression that comes with it) since I was around 14-15. I just turned 26F.  


Lately in the last couple weeks.. I feel like I’m in an awful rut. I don’t even know where it came from.. my medication was all over, my doctor put me on 120mg (Cymbalta). I only took it for a couple days. It made me feel super out of it. So now I’m back down to 90 mg. I’ve just been feeling down/ bad thoughts, my OCD stuff and then ‘nothing matters’, ‘everything is pointless’ ‘waiting for happiness’ ‘nothing will help me’. 

I’ve tried 3 medications now (Zoloft only for 3 weeks), lexapro for around 5 months and now cymbalta for around 3? And I get into really negative loops of thinking and just ‘it’ll never get better’ ‘I’m a lost cause’ ‘I’ll always suffer’, or that I’m broken/unfixable. My anxiety has been back as well a bit. In my chest. Like anguish almost. Grieving over my grandpa has been incredibly hard as well. I lost him at Christmas. I watched him die and it was one of the worst things I’ve dealt with in my adult life so far. I also work in palliative care so I know that does not help my mental health at all, and I’m overworked. So I’m burnt out and constantly struggling to not be tired/overwhelmed/irritable. I’ve been feeling general apathy and just not enjoying a lot of things and isolating myself. I just hate mental health issues. I hate feeling like I want to give up. And I’m sorry for rambling as well or if this doesn’t make a lot of sense. I’m not the type of person to ever talk about my problems or especially post online to strangers, but I just feel lost right now. It makes me feel broken. I was never like this until I took Zoloft. ( I know so many people that Zoloft has saved their livelihood and gave them their life back, I was just unlucky with it, I in no way want to bad mouth medication or scare people), but it ruined my mental health. My dad leaving, my ex and I breaking up and me quitting weed cold turkey, work mental breakdown / stress overload and Zoloft sent me into a s. depression that’s lasted an entire year now (I’m not going to hurt myself nor am I in danger). Within days my mind was racing and I couldn’t be alone on Zoloft. It was the worst experience of my life. I wouldn’t wish it on my worst enemy. It was all at the same timeline-couple months. It broke me. And now I don’t know how to get back or if it’s even possible. I want to think it is? I hope it is. If you made it this far thank you so much for listening. I want to be a positive beacon for other people and give them hope as well. I will say Cymbalta has helped me so much, I just don’t know if it suddenly stopped working or if I’m just in a rut. Any tips, reassurance or advice would be greatly appreciated.

I get that she thinks that she's warning me of some possible dangers but does it have to be every fucking time? I guess she's trying to protect me but it made me very cautious and even scared of doing normal everyday things, such as driving for example, I feel scared of driving because what if I kill someone or even myself? Sometimes I even feel scared to fall asleep cause what if there's am earthquake during the night. One time I went on a vacation with my girlfriends and couldn't relax at all cause I kept on thinking someone might kidnap or murder us lol.

1jc2bdf,anxietyhelp,2025-03-15 18:57:30,Struggling with anxiety symptoms? Please read!,"I want to start with saying that I absolutely love this community. It both breaks my heart and heals it knowing there are so many out there who are struggling along side with me, it makes me grateful that we all have a place to seek and get help.

That being said I’d like to share something that I’ve learned recently in my own journey with anxiety that I feel more people should know about. Though this is something not even any of my therapists have shared with me, this is just from my own research.

So we all know of our flight or fight mechanism.

And if you didn’t already know, this is where your “anxiety headquarters” are, this is what’s triggering your anxiety symptoms.

So let’s have a little biology class here.

Your brain has a part of it called the amygdala, when it senses danger it’ll distress signal the brain stem and hypothalamus, this is what sends the message to your nervous system to communicate to you that there is “danger.” Even if subconsciously you know nothing is going to kill you, even if you’re just laying in bed, sitting in class, working your 9-5.

This is flight or fight, why your palms sweat, why your heart beats so fast it hurts, why your thoughts seem uncontrollable, why your shallow breathing before you even notice that you are. 

This is where a lot of us get trapped, I do too even now, it will always be a battle.

But let me wield you this weapon called “rest and digest” Your body’s counteractive to the flight or fight mechanism.

Rest and digest works through your parasympathetic nervous system. 

What is that?

Well like I said it’s responsible for rest and digestion, which is how your body promotes relaxation and recovery after a stressful ordeal.

Let me say.. mindfulness techniques you’re told to do like breathing and meditation actually do work, but they didn’t for me at first.

My mind would race with a stronger force than I could use to calm me down bc how the fuck is breathing going to help me.. why am I even doing it? Can someone actually just help me instead of telling me to breathe?!

These mindfulness techniques are how you ACTIVATE your parasympathetic nervous system, so that you can utilize your body’s rest and digest mechanism. 

Before I knew why I was being told to breathe and all of that, these techniques didn’t work for me, my mind would win. 

You can’t win a race if you don’t know where your destination will be and the route it takes to get there. 

Now that I do I can calm myself pretty “easily”
I still get anxious for no reason just laying in bed, lightheadedness, heart palpitations, all that jazz. It’s just now I know the route to get okay.

It’s a lot more than just knowing about your parasympathetic nervous system, it’s a tool you have to actively utilize and try to tap into.

Here are some pointers:

1. When you feel anxious, make peace with it.

  “Okay my hearts beating fast and I’m breathing pretty shallow, this is my body’s way of communicating with me that it thinks there is danger near by, since I see that there isn’t I will reassure my body that everything is okay.”

Telling myself this either out loud or in my head helps a lot.

2. Do not for the love of god practice any negative self talk or thoughts. 

  You are not weak for the way that you feel so don’t you dare tell yourself that you are. You are not alone in the way that you feel. You ARE strong and you will overcome this fear that you’re feeling because you have survived this before. 

Negativity just fuels anxiety, like wind to wildfires, though you might not even notice it.

Acknowledge these thoughts trying to get in but give them ZERO power, throw those thoughts away.

3.  In fact, you should do POSITIVE self talk.

“I will be okay I can get through this.” 
“I have the tools and mechanisms to make myself better.” 
“This feeling will pass through and I will be okay because I have been before.”


4. Trust in your mindfulness techniques.

Take a deep breath in while tensing all your muscles, breath out while releasing them. Do that two more times if needed to fully relax your muscles, and continue with just breathing after.

Keep your hand on your belly if you can, to monitor your belly rising and falling as you breathe, this can ensure that you are consciously taking deep breaths, not allowing the anxious shallow breaths to come back.

This is when you should be doing positive self thinking, along side with your breathing.

5. The only thing that exists is you, your breathing, and positive thinking.

Do that, exactly that.

Just breathe and tell yourself you’re going to be okay. You’re doing the process, you’re on the road to recovery. Everything you’re doing will activate your rest and digest if you just solely focus on what I’m advising you.

Keeping doing that process.

Eventually you’ll notice you’re only focusing about your breathing and positive thinking, you’ll notice that you’re starting to feel okay, even possibly tired from the adrenaline leaving your system. 

It is far easier said than done, it is a mental battle. You could catch me any day of the week having to do this, sometimes it takes an hour, sometimes it takes an hour 30 minutes.

The sheer knowledge of the existence of the parasympathetic nervous, how it works, rest and digest, and the fact that I have these tools built into me to calm down, helps so fucking much for me.

So in summary what you’re trying to do is take the power away from your flight or fight in your nervous system, and hand it over to the parasympathetic nervous system so that you can utilize rest and digest.

I hope this knowledge helps you as much as me! 
If you read this whole wall of text just know that you are absolutely incredible. 

You are strong.
You are deserving of feeling safe and relaxed.

But here recently i feel like i know why. I’m genuinely scared of growing up, getting old, and dying. I feel like everything i’m doing, everything i buy, eat, drink, legitimately does not matter because i will die anyway. I feel like time goes by so so so fast and that everything i do will just become a faded memory overtime. I recently started having a chronic fear of death and i think it’s because i feel like im running out of time very quickly. I literally blink and 6 months have gone past and it freaks me out. I always spiral too and think “i’ll never be able to go back and be a kid, whenever my pets and parents die i’ll never be able to go back and see them” and it makes me really sad. I also tend to dwell on my snap or camera roll memories a lot and it makes me feel so sad seeing my youth fade the more i get older. I’m starting to go to therapy but i just want opinions to see if im the only one that deals with it and maybe how you guys accepted it or just moved on from the whole concept and started to enjoy life.. i would always love to hear what you guys think happens after death.

1jdhq9t,anxietyhelp,2025-03-17 17:03:27,I fought my anxiety and something good happened because of it,"This morning, I woke up anxious and I never wake up anxious.  I sat in my bed until when my class started freaked out.  I fought with myself that being late would be better than not going at all.

I left 15 minutes late and then was so anxious I sat in my car and the bathroom until it was an hour into my 2 hour class.  I was freaked out.

I decided that I wanted still go, and it was the right thing to do.

Turns out, we had a unit test today 

I thought about lying, but I just told my teacher “I have bipolar disorder and I struggle with anxiety” and explained

He told me it’s a two hour class, and it’s an hour long test, so I still had time to take it

I ended up getting an 84, and that would have been almost 200 points towards 30% of my grade I would have completely missed

So I just wanted to share this success and say, so the scary thing, try to fight it.

People will understand in most cases. 

If I had skipped class, I would have been so disappointed in myself when I found out I missed a unit test and it really did turn out that showing up a little late and really scared is better than not doing it at all

1j0es8i,anxietyhelp,2025-02-28 18:34:42,What Really Triggers Panic Attacks (And How to Stop Them Before They Spiral Out of Control),"Hey everyone,  

If you're reading this, you're probably someone who's battled with panic attacks or anxiety attacks — or maybe you're in the middle of trying to figure out what the hell is happening to your body and mind right now. First of all, I just want to say... I get it.  

Anxiety is one of the most **lonely and invisible struggles** out there. On the outside, you might look totally fine — but inside? It feels like you're fighting a war nobody else can see.  

I want to break down something that took me years to fully understand:  

**What actually induces a panic attack... and how to stop it before it snowballs into that out-of-control fear spiral.**  

---

### What REALLY Triggers Panic Attacks (It's Not What You Think)
A lot of people think panic attacks come out of nowhere — but they don't. They always have a trigger. The tricky part is... the trigger usually happens **hours** before the panic attack actually hits.  

For me, the cycle always looked like this:  
- A small thought flickers through my mind — something random like ""What if I faint in public?""  
- I brush it off... or at least I **think** I do.  
- Hours later, I feel a little off — maybe my heart is beating faster or I feel lightheaded.  
- Suddenly, my brain goes **""WAIT... what if this is the start of a panic attack?""**  
- BOOM — full-blown panic mode.  

Sound familiar?  

Here's the brutal truth:  
Panic attacks aren't just about what's happening in the moment — they're about how your brain **interprets what's happening.**  

---

### Why Your Brain Is Tricking You
Your brain is doing something called **misfiring danger signals** — it's literally trying to protect you... but it's protecting you from a threat that doesn't even exist.  

That's why your heart races.  
That's why your chest tightens.  
That's why you feel like you're going to pass out — or even die.  

But here's the kicker:  
**Nobody has ever died from a panic attack.** Not one person. Ever.  

Your brain is **lying to you** — but it feels so damn real, doesn't it?  

---

### How to Stop a Panic Attack (Before It Even Starts)
Most advice out there is all about riding the wave — which works for some people... but if you're like me, you don't want to wait around and ""let it pass.""  

Here's the best trick I've ever learned:  

**Interrupt the fear loop before it locks you in.**  

The second you feel that first wave of anxiety — the heart racing, the dizziness, the ""Oh no, it's happening"" thought — try this:  

1. **Talk to your panic like it's a person.**  
Literally say (out loud if you can):  
""Okay, I see you. You're trying to protect me right now, but I'm actually safe.""  

2. **Engage your logical brain.**  
Ask yourself:  
- What am I afraid is going to happen?  
- Has that ever actually happened to me before?  
- Even if it did... would I survive it?  

3. **Ground yourself FAST.**  
The fastest grounding trick I've ever found is to grab something cold — ice, a cold can, anything — and hold it in your hands. Your brain literally can't focus on panic while it's processing cold sensations.  

---

### The Most Important Thing Nobody Tells You
Anxiety feeds off **isolation.**  

When you're alone in your head, your thoughts become bigger, scarier, and louder. The best way to shrink anxiety down to size is to **talk about it** — even if you're just talking to yourself at first.  

I know how exhausting this journey feels. I've been there, googling symptoms at 3AM, crying because I genuinely thought I'd never feel normal again.  

But here's what I wish someone told me back then:  
**You can rewire your brain.**  

Anxiety isn't a life sentence. You don't have to white-knuckle through every attack for the rest of your life. There are actual step-by-step ways to break out of this cycle — I recently stumbled on this guide that explains the whole process:  

👉 [Freedom From Fear: A Step-by-Step Guide to Conquering Panic Attacks](https://www.anxietysupports.com/p/freedom-from-fear-a-step-by-step-guide-to-conquering-panic-attacks/676da2416fb4d2d516d0b4ac)  

It honestly changed the way I see anxiety — not like some monster that's always going to haunt me... but just **a pattern that my brain accidentally learned and can unlearn** with the right tools.  

---

### If You're Reading This, You're Not Broken
You're not weak. You're not crazy. You're just someone whose brain got a little too good at trying to protect them.  

If you're still in the thick of it right now, I know how hard it is to believe you'll ever feel normal again — but I swear to you, that day is coming.  

You are going to laugh without fear again.  
You're going to wake up and forget what anxiety even feels like.  
You're going to feel **free** in your own mind.  

I don't know who needs to hear this... but you're not alone.  

If anyone wants to talk or just vent, my inbox is always open. We're in this together. 💪  

---

**TL;DR:**  
Panic attacks aren't random — they're your brain trying to protect you from a false alarm. The key to stopping them is breaking the fear loop before it takes hold. If you're looking for a structured way to finally break free from panic attacks, check out this guide that helped me a ton:

1jd0p7m,anxietyhelp,2025-03-17 00:57:19,I had a panic attack and think it changed everything.,"This isn’t much of a “helpful” tip but couldn’t think of the right tag. To start- I’m fairly new to anxiety. Growing up I didn’t “believe in anxiety”, never worried or panicked about anything. Two years ago I was in a car accident and all of the sudden I experienced anxiety, anxiety attacks & derealization/delersonalization (I think; I felt anxious all the time and felt unfamiliar in familiar surroundings like my childhood house I grew up and still live in). Since then I’ve really only had a type of ocd health anxiety, always thinking there’s something wrong with me, but otherwise am fine. Recently I had my first panic attack and did not what was happening to me, my face mouth and hands were numb and locked up and I felt like I couldn’t swallow or catch my breathe. My bf ended up calling 911 and I went to the er, again it was just a panic attack. 
I’ve always been pretty good at talking myself out of a panic attack telling myself I’m just anxious, but since then I really truly feel like all anxiety I’ve ever felt has left my body. Now, I genuinely know it’s not real and your brain is a very powerful thing, anxiety can give you real physical symptoms like this. Before people could tell me till they were blue in the face that it was all in my head but now I really know that it is. 
I guess the point of this is to tell help others know, it isn’t real and it DOES get better. I wish anyone else who’s ever felt this all the best and know you’re not alone!!

The last few months especially ive been extra down and pretty numb, i feel on edge and like I couldn’t give half a shit about anything and dopamine is the only real thing that feels good, I feel happy at times but it’s fleeting and positive thinking takes much more mental effort than negative which feels automatic. Worst of all in situations where I want to feel happy I feel most anxious because I don’t feel how i think I should feel and it makes me go into “something isn’t right here” mode and my brain makes my whole body stressed out.


Where I’m going with this is to those who felt like me - how did you get out of the negative thinking patterns? Was it self compassion and being grateful for small things?

1jd9hnx,anxietyhelp,2025-03-17 10:30:39,How do you get over your dental fears?,"I need about $3,000 of work done on my teeth because I did not take care of them in recent years or seen a dentist in 5 years. I need a deep cleaning, today, then a crown, and two fillings.

Money issues and insurance where one, but my dental phobia is worse.

I remember as a kid my mom would take out her dental phobia on me. Anytime she had a issue, she'd come back home to yell at me to brush my teeth and to follow whatever care plan for her. She wouldn't take me to enough cleanings, about once every other year, and then would shame me for tarter buildup.

I was 29 years old when I learned tarter buildup is not always your fault and that's why you need to go in every 6 months for a cleaning. But these guys want me in every 3 months because my gum disease was pretty bad.

Then a part that plays in my head constantly is when I was a kid, I remember one period where I thought I was being very good with my teeth finally. Went to the dentist for a cleaning and they found a piece of food in one part of my teeth that always gives me issues, even with flossing, and she literally yelled at me about how if I don't learn, I'm going to lose my teeth by the time I'm 20 and even implied I was a lost cause.  It's stuck with me for years.

Yesterday I had 3 separate panic attacks about just this deep cleaning.

Edit: I had a bit backwards and it was actually my crown appointment today, not the deep cleaning. But while I had a really anxious time I was able to keep calm. Probably because both I took ashwagandha before the appointment, and then they numbed me up really good so I didn't feel anything really. I just closed my eyes when they brought out the needle so I never even saw what it looked like. I had to be numbed up twice because I only felt some cold sensitivity when they they started drilling.

1j3i78e,anxietyhelp,2025-03-04 18:47:50,Sudden Anxiety in Public Places: How to Act Fast Without Anyone Noticing (A Psychological Guide),"There’s nothing quite like the feeling of anxiety hitting you out of nowhere — especially in public.  

One minute you're fine, blending in with the crowd — and the next, your heart is racing, your breathing feels wrong, and you're desperately scanning the room, hoping nobody notices the storm brewing inside you.  

If you've ever felt that **wave of panic rising in the middle of a grocery store, a classroom, or at work — completely out of the blue — this post is for you**. Because I know exactly how isolating it feels to be trapped inside your own mind, trying to act normal while everything in your body is screaming that you're not.  

### Why Does Anxiety Hit When You Least Expect It?  
The cruel part about anxiety is that it **loves catching you off guard**. When you're at home, the symptoms might feel manageable. But the second you're out in the world — surrounded by people — it feels like your mind flips a switch.  

Suddenly, your body goes into fight-or-flight mode...  
Even when there's **no real danger** around.  

The worst part?  
Nobody around you knows what's happening. You could be sitting at a café or walking down the street, looking completely normal — while inside, you're fighting what feels like a life-or-death battle.  

And if you're anything like me, your biggest fear isn't just the panic itself...  
It's the fear of **someone noticing**.  

### The Psychological Trick That Changed Everything
Here's something that took me way too long to learn:  

Most people are too caught up in their own world to notice what's happening to you.  

That person behind the counter? They're thinking about their next break.  
The guy walking past you? He's replaying an argument he had two days ago.  
The group laughing at the table? They're probably stressing about their own problems the second they leave.  

The truth is... **Nobody is watching you as closely as you think**.  

When I started repeating this to myself mid-panic attack, something clicked.  
It didn't make the anxiety disappear completely — but it gave me just enough space to stop fighting against it.  

### How to Act Fast (Without Anyone Noticing)
Over time, I've built a little **emergency plan** I use whenever anxiety creeps up in public — and I promise you, nobody will ever know you're using it:  

1. **Name 5 objects in the room silently in your head**.  
It forces your brain to switch from panic mode to observation mode. The mind can't panic and observe at the same time.  

2. **Breathe like you're trying to calm someone else down**.  
Not deep, dramatic breaths — just slow, steady ones like you're comforting a scared child.  

3. **Sip water if you have it** — or even pretend to sip from an empty bottle. It gives your hands something to do and tricks your brain into thinking you're in control.  

4. **Ground yourself with a secret touch signal** — like pressing your thumb and index finger together or tapping your leg three times. It's your own little reminder that you're still here, still safe.  

5. **Remind yourself: ""Nobody knows I'm anxious right now""**. Because they don't. And even if they did — so what? Anxiety doesn't make you weak. It makes you human.  

### What Happens If You Just... Let It Be?
This part is hard.  
But what if — instead of fighting the panic — you simply **let it ride out**?  

What if you stood there, heart racing, hands shaking... and told yourself:  

**""I can handle this.""**  
**""This feeling isn't dangerous.""**  
**""It will pass — just like it always does.""**  

Because the truth is — anxiety always passes.  
Every. Single. Time.  

Even if it feels unbearable in the moment... you've survived every panic attack you've ever had. And you'll survive this one too.  

---

If you're reading this and you've been struggling in silence — I want you to know you're not alone. I've been there. I'm probably still there more often than I'd like to admit.  

But I've also learned something really important along the way:  
**Anxiety loses power the second you stop trying to hide it.**  

If you're looking for more tools to break free from anxiety (without relying on meds or waiting for it to magically disappear), there's something that helped me massively:  
👉 [The Anti-Anxiety Formula](https://www.anxietysupports.com/p/the-anti-anxiety-formula/676c36b8f5a09abff8e98e6b)  

It's one of the most **down-to-earth, practical guides** I've ever found — written by someone who actually gets what it's like to live with anxiety every day. Nothing gimmicky, just real techniques that work when you're in the middle of panic mode.  

At the end of the day... you're not broken.  
You're not weak.  
You're just someone who's learning how to **navigate life with a sensitive nervous system** — and that makes you stronger than most people will ever understand.

1j2qbz8,anxietyhelp,2025-03-03 18:58:17,10 Ways to Calm Your Anxious Mind and Stay Calm (Even When Life Feels Out of Control),"Hey everyone,  

I know how hard it can be to deal with anxiety — that constant battle between wanting peace and feeling like your own mind is working against you. If you're reading this, I just want to say... I see you. You're not alone in this fight.  

I've been there — those sleepless nights, the racing thoughts that won't let up, the tightness in your chest that makes you feel like you're losing control. Anxiety makes you question everything, even your own ability to cope.  

But here's what I've learned: Your mind is **not your enemy** — it just needs to be gently guided back to a place of calm. It's not about silencing every thought — it's about **building a relationship with your mind** where you feel in control again.  

I want to share 10 ways that have genuinely helped me calm my mind from anxiety and stay calm even when life feels like it's spiraling. These aren't just generic tips — these are the things that have helped me survive the worst of it.  

---

### 1. Breathe like you're already calm  
Most people tell you to take deep breaths... but here's the secret: Don't breathe like you're anxious. Breathe like you're already calm. Slow, gentle, through your nose. Your mind follows what your body does — not the other way around.  

---

### 2. Talk to your anxiety like it's a scared child  
What if I told you your anxiety isn't trying to hurt you — it's trying to **protect you** in the only way it knows how? Instead of fighting it, try saying:  
*""I know you're trying to keep me safe... but I don't need you right now. We're okay.""*  

---

### 3. Anchor yourself to the present moment  
When your mind is racing, it's usually because it's in the **future** — worrying about what might happen. Find **one small thing** around you right now — the feeling of your shirt on your skin, the sound of your breathing, or even the warmth of your coffee mug. Hold onto that sensation like a lifeline.  

---

### 4. The 90-Second Rule  
Did you know that most anxious thoughts only last **90 seconds** unless you keep feeding them? The next time anxiety hits, set a timer. Let the wave rise... and wait. It will pass faster than you think if you stop wrestling with it.  

---

### 5. Name Your Anxiety
Give it a name — seriously. It sounds silly, but it creates a little distance between **you** and the voice in your head. Next time your mind starts spiraling, try saying...  
*""Oh great, Karen is back with her disaster scenarios again.""*  

---

### 6. Let Go of Needing to Feel 100% Calm  
This one hit me hard when I first heard it. What if the goal isn't to feel **perfectly calm** — but just... a little calmer than before? What if feeling 10% calmer is **enough** right now?  

---

### 7. Create a ""Safe Space"" Playlist  
I can't explain the magic of music when you're anxious. But not just any music — songs that feel like **safety**. Songs that remind you of better days or make you feel held. For me, it's stuff like Bon Iver or lo-fi beats. What's yours?  

---

### 8. Ask Yourself: ""What would the calm version of me do right now?""  
Even when you're panicking, there's still a version of you that knows how to handle this. That version of you already exists — they just need a little nudge. Close your eyes and ask yourself...  
*""What would calm me do right now?""*  

---

### 9. The Mind Trick That Blew My Mind  
Here's something wild: Your brain can't tell the difference between imagination and reality. If you **picture yourself calm** — sitting on a beach, lying in bed, walking through a forest — your body will start to respond as if you're really there.  

---

### 10. Give Yourself Permission to Rest  
Anxiety is exhausting. You don't have to earn your rest. You're not lazy — you're healing. Let yourself rest without guilt. You're allowed to just **be** right now.  

---

### You're Not Broken — You're Just Tired
I know how easy it is to feel like you're weak for struggling with anxiety. But you're not weak — you're just **tired** from carrying this weight alone for so long.  

If you're looking for something to help calm your mind on the hardest days, I recommend this guide that genuinely made me feel seen. It's not just another list of tips — it's like having someone walk you through how to actually retrain your anxious mind step by step.  

👉[ Here's the link if you want to check it out: ](https://www.anxietysupports.com/p/the-calm-mind/676dbe236fb4d2d516d0b503) 
  

No pressure — I just know how rare it is to find something that actually helps without feeling like a quick fix or empty advice.

1j863w1,anxietyhelp,2025-03-10 18:47:18,The Slow Burn of Anxiety and Depression—And How to Take Back Control,"Have you ever felt like you’re stuck in a loop? Like every day blends into the next, and no matter how much you try to change things, it all just keeps pulling you back? Anxiety and depression don’t show up overnight. They creep in, slowly, quietly, until one day, you realize you’ve been living with them for years.  

Maybe it started with small worries—""Did I say something stupid?"" or ""What if I fail?"" At first, it felt normal. But then, those thoughts became heavier, louder. They started dictating your decisions. You stopped reaching out to people because socializing felt like too much effort. You lost motivation because, what’s the point? Life felt overwhelming, exhausting, and no matter how much you wanted to ""snap out of it,"" you just… couldn't.  

### **How Anxiety and Depression Form**  

1. **The Pressure to Be ""Enough""**  
   We live in a world that demands results. Get good grades. Get a good job. Be liked. Be successful. But what happens when you start believing you’ll never measure up? That no matter what you do, you’re always falling short? Anxiety thrives on this fear. Depression feeds on the exhaustion of trying and failing (or fearing you will).  

2. **Past Trauma and Unresolved Pain**  
   Maybe it was something that happened years ago—a bad childhood, bullying, an abusive relationship, or even just years of feeling unheard. Those experiences don’t just fade. They settle deep inside you, shaping how you see yourself and the world. And if you never learned how to process them? They fester.  

3. **The Mind as a Battleground**  
   If you struggle with anxiety, you probably know what it’s like to battle your own mind. It’s a constant war between ""I need to do this"" and ""I can’t."" Depression is like a heavy fog that rolls in and tells you it doesn’t matter anyway. The worst part? These thoughts feel *real*. They sound like *your* voice. But they’re not you—they’re symptoms of something deeper.  

### **How to Break Free**  

I won’t lie and say it’s easy. If it were, we wouldn’t have so many people silently struggling. But the good news? You’re not powerless.  

#### **1. Recognize That Your Thoughts Are Not Facts**  
   Anxiety tells you the worst-case scenario is inevitable. Depression tells you that nothing will change. Both are liars. When these thoughts hit, ask yourself: *Is this a fact or just fear?* Challenge them like you’d challenge a friend who was being too hard on themselves.  

#### **2. Take Tiny, Defiant Steps**  
   When you’re in the grip of depression, even getting out of bed feels like a battle. But here’s something I learned: small actions have power. Drink a glass of water. Step outside for five minutes. Reply to one message. These seem insignificant, but they add up. Every small action is a middle finger to the part of your brain telling you to give up.  

#### **3. Stop Fighting Your Feelings—Observe Them Instead**  
   Instead of resisting anxiety or depression, try observing them. When you feel anxious, instead of thinking, *Oh no, not this again*, say, *I feel anxious right now. My body is reacting to stress. It will pass.* The more you observe without judgment, the less power these emotions have.  

#### **4. Learn to Sit With Discomfort**  
   The reason anxiety and depression are so powerful is that we want to escape them. But here’s the thing: trying to push them away gives them control. Instead, sit with them. Feel them. Understand them. Over time, their grip loosens.  

#### **5. Find the Right Support**  
   No one should fight this battle alone. Whether it’s therapy, support groups, or just reading something that makes you feel less alone, connection helps. I found this guide really insightful: [Finding Your Way: A Survivor’s Guide to Overcoming Depression](https://www.anxietysupports.com/p/finding-your-way-a-survivors-guide-to-overcoming-depression/676da3fe6fb4d2d516d0b4b2). It breaks things down in a way that actually makes sense and feels real—not like the generic “just think positive” nonsense.  

### **Final Thoughts**  

If you’re reading this and feeling stuck, I want you to know: you are not broken. You are not weak. You are a person dealing with something incredibly hard, and you are still here. That means something.  

You won’t wake up tomorrow and suddenly feel ""fixed."" But you *can* wake up tomorrow and take one step forward. And then another. And another.  

One day, you’ll look back and realize—you made it. And damn, that will be a beautiful moment.",11,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxietyhelp/comments/1j863w1/the_slow_burn_of_anxiety_and_depressionand_how_to/,Slow Burn Anxiety DepressionAnd Take Back Control ever felt like youre stuck loop Like every day blends next matter much try change things keeps pulling back Anxiety depression dont show overnight creep slowly quietly one day realize youve living years Maybe started small worriesDid say something stupid fail first felt normal thoughts became heavier louder started dictating decisions stopped reaching people socializing felt like much effort lost motivation whats point Life felt overwhelming exhausting matter much wanted snap couldnt Anxiety Depression Form 1 Pressure Enough live world demands results Get good grades Get good job liked successful happens start believing youll never measure matter youre always falling short Anxiety thrives fear Depression feeds exhaustion trying failing fearing 2 Past Trauma Unresolved Pain Maybe something happened years agoa bad childhood bullying abusive relationship even years feeling unheard experiences dont fade settle deep inside shaping see world never learned process fester 3 Mind Battleground struggle anxiety probably know like battle mind constant war need cant Depression like heavy fog rolls tells doesnt matter anyway worst part thoughts feel real sound like voice theyre youtheyre symptoms something deeper Break Free wont lie say easy wouldnt many people silently struggling good news Youre powerless 1 Recognize Thoughts Facts Anxiety tells worstcase scenario inevitable Depression tells nothing change liars thoughts hit ask fact fear Challenge like youd challenge friend hard 2 Take Tiny Defiant Steps youre grip depression even getting bed feels like battle heres something learned small actions power Drink glass water Step outside five minutes Reply one message seem insignificant add Every small action middle finger part brain telling give 3 Stop Fighting FeelingsObserve Instead Instead resisting anxiety depression try observing feel anxious instead thinking Oh say feel anxious right body reacting stress pass observe without judgment less power emotions 4 Learn Sit Discomfort reason anxiety depression powerful want escape heres thing trying push away gives control Instead sit Feel Understand time grip loosens 5 Find Right Support one fight battle alone Whether therapy support groups reading something makes feel less alone connection helps found guide really insightful Finding Way Survivors Guide Overcoming Depression breaks things way actually makes sense feels realnot like generic think positive nonsense Final Thoughts youre reading feeling stuck want know broken weak person dealing something incredibly hard still means something wont wake tomorrow suddenly feel fixed wake tomorrow take one step forward another another One day youll look back realizeyou made damn beautiful moment

I’ve had X-rays, ultrasounds, ct scans, mris and nothing much showed. I’ve also had heart testing because my symptoms looked like they were related but nothing. This was back in July. Since then I have been having really bad chest pain, dizziness, and panic attacks often. Sometimes when I’m laying in bed trying to fall asleep, I feel like I can’t breathe and jump up trying to catch a breath.

i have convinced myself that now that i have gotten this vaccine, my heart is going to give out. i feel so stupid and irrational for feeling this way because i never thought this way before getting the vaccine. i think a lot of my fear stems from the fact that it is my parents that say it will kill you and it causes issues. 

so all in all, i guess im wanting to know if anyone has ever actually died from the covid vaccine and if they have, were they in their early twenties with no prior health conditions? 

any other advice is appreciated. im not sure why i feel like this now after not feeling this way for so long and WANTING the vaccine.

1j8dvx8,anxietyhelp,2025-03-11 00:19:16,"I have social anxiety that keeps me isolated and alone. However, I’m terrified at even the idea of taking meds or even reporting my own mental condition.","So I’m 26 and anxious around people. This means the only friends I have are the ones from highschool who are still in my life. It’s getting to be about that age where people are charting their own courses and getting settled down or moving away. I don’t resent them for it, that would be childish and unfair. But I do feel sad because I feel like I’m being left behind and I don’t see anywhere to go. Or a path forward. I don’t want to be alone. The thought makes me depressed and the reality I imagine is gonna be a lot worse once it hits.

So, I’d like to be able to socialize. To create my own little circle of friends in present day. I love my highschool friends and it’s not like I could ever replace them. But I need a social circle that is more so structured around my current life; the present day. I’d also like to be in a relationship and go down that path as well. All I do with my life nowadays is play single player video games and smoke weed. Occasionally I’ll hang with one of my few friends. Work and doom scroll the rest of the time. 

But I’m so socially anxious. My mind goes blank or simply just focuses on my own internal state when I’m around people. Especially one on one conversation. In groups I can hang in the background but then I’m just basically not present which is pointless for socializing. In interactions I feel like I’m looking for the quickest way to politely end the conversation in a way that seems natural. Then I regret and lament that I did and fantasize all the things I could have said that I couldn’t think of in the moment. 

In the moment it’s not like I’m refusing to say things it’s more like I just have no words that aren’t me reflecting on my own internal state. If someone talks to me about their day it’s not like I’m just gonna respond *“I’m anxious right now because you’re talking to me and I have nothing to say because I’m anxious and am so consumed by my own internal state that I can’t even relate to you or your day right now”* because that’s how you never get talked to again and it doesn’t lead to the problem going away. 

Anyways, part of me wonders if the only way forward is meds but the idea of taking meds makes my stomach turn. Reminds me of how I felt the last time I did a psychedelic and had it in my hand while on the tip of an anxiety attack thinking about it. Just sickening. I worry about all these side effects. I worry about permanent effects. I worry that I’m selling my personality to a drug market. That I’m gonna lose myself. I worry I’ll be dependent on it forever. Or addicted. I worry about how it may prevent me from doing certain activities potentially. I worry how I might be judged or how my mental state being on record could be used against me in court for whatever reason in the future. All sorts of worries.

Anyone have these issues? Any thoughts? Even right now my stomach is twisted in a knot and my chest feels heavy. I’m not gonna have a panic attack or anything.

1j7gs2k,anxietyhelp,2025-03-09 20:26:26,Need a third-person perspective? Just someone to listen? I’m here...,"
Hey,  

I’m not a mental health professional or anything like that. Just someone who knows that sometimes, all you need is an outside perspective—a friend to listen, ask the right questions, and help you untangle thoughts that feel like a mess in your head.  

I’ve been in situations where overthinking made things way worse than they actually were. I’ve also had friends come to me when they were feeling lost—whether it was a breakup, family issues, or just feeling stuck in life—and I’ve noticed that just saying things out loud can make a huge difference. No judgments, no ""just be positive"" clichés—just someone to hear you out.  

Some things I’ve helped my friends with before:  
- A friend after a tough breakup—she was stuck in guilt, thinking she had ""wasted"" a year. But when she talked it through, she realized she had learned something valuable instead.  
- Someone struggling with family pressure and expectations—they felt unheard, but when we broke it down, they realized part of the issue was that they never actually expressed what they wanted.  
- A friend debating whether to end a relationship—they kept saying ""but what if,"" and after talking, they admitted they already knew the answer but just needed to hear themselves say it.  
- Even for myself—I once realized I was giving friends solid advice but ignoring my own reality, and when I finally applied the same clarity to my own life, I made the right call on something I had been stuck on for months.  

So yeah, if you feel like you’re overthinking something, stuck on a decision, or just need to say it out loud to someone who doesn’t know you personally, I’m here. No harm in getting a fresh perspective, right? It’s an anonymous space—what’s the worst that can happen?  

Drop a comment, DM me, whatever works for you. Sometimes, just putting it into words is enough.

No reply, no reassurance, just an absence where a connection once was.

I wasn’t looking for sympathy. I wasn’t trying to be a burden. I just needed to be real about what was weighing on me—my anxiety, my struggles, my thoughts that sometimes feel too heavy to carry alone. But instead of support, I got distance. Instead of understanding, I got ignored.

It makes you question everything. Were they ever really a friend or a family ? Did they care, or was it just convenience? Because the truth is, real friends or family don’t disappear when things get hard.

To anyone who has experienced this: Your feelings are not too much. Your struggles don’t make you unworthy of support. The right people—the ones who truly care—will never leave you alone in the dark.

TW: suicidal ideation

About four years ago, after a long time of having general anxiety disorder, I experienced a panic attack that sent my body into such a mental and physical breakdown that I finally started medication and therapy. I would wake up to my heart racing, my body twitching, my chest and stomach clamped, and worse than all those combined, my thoughts deliriously spiraling into suicidal ideation. It's horrific but my meds did a great job of literally erasing these symptoms and allowing me to be stressed without spiraling. I've been on and off different dosages of Lexapro but over the last year I came to accept that I should stay on it because every time I go off, my body under any stress at all goes into that awful fight-or-flight.

I had a new stressor in my life recently that prompted me to increase my med dosage by a little bit about two weeks ago. The increase felt good, and I traveled to a different time zone gor a week where I was taking my meds at a different time than usual. I felt great, then upon return I came down with a stomach bug - and wham, my anxiety disorder came back full force despite me still being on my meds. This has never happened before to me and is extremely extremely distressing because normally if I experience my fight-or-flight symptoms I can bravely sit through them by telling myself ""this will pass, the symptoms are worst when you wake up and will be over by noon, and then they will fade by ten days and be completely gone by 4 or 5 weeks on the meds"". 

But now I'm sitting here after a night of struggling to sleep because my body and mind won't let me calm down. I'm so frightened and alarmed because my symptoms have never persisted while on meds and into the night like this before. It makes me feel like genuinely my body is trying to take me out - like wtf would happen to me if I didn't have meds at all? It's so scary and I don't understand how to get through it in one piece when I'm having to trick my body into sleep and my mind is waking me up saying ""let's replay every sin you've ever committed and remind you you're going to hell.""

1j16866,anxietyhelp,2025-03-01 18:30:47,How Childhood Trauma Silently Shapes Your Life — And How to Break Free,"Have you ever wondered why certain feelings follow you no matter how much you try to move on? Why you're constantly battling self-doubt, fear of abandonment, or this heavy weight of sadness without any clear reason?  

What if I told you... the battles you're fighting today might have started long before you even realized?  

Childhood trauma isn't always about something catastrophic. It's not always the broken bones, the screaming fights, or the moments that left visible scars.  
Sometimes, it's the absence of warmth.  
It's the parent who never said, ""I'm proud of you.""  
It's the constant pressure to be perfect.  
It's the fear of making a mistake because love always felt like something you had to earn.  

### The Silent Prison
What makes childhood trauma so dangerous is how silently it builds inside of us. As kids, we don't have the ability to say, ""This is hurting me."" We just survive.  

But what happens when survival becomes your entire personality?  

You grow into an adult who:  
- Overthinks every decision, terrified of disappointing people.  
- Pushes people away because deep down you don't believe you're worthy of love.  
- Craves validation but hates needing anyone.  
- Feels guilty for resting because you've been wired to believe you're only valuable when you're productive.  

Nobody talks about how childhood trauma builds layer by layer — until one day you're 25, 30, or even 50 years old, sitting in your room wondering why life feels so heavy when nothing is technically ""wrong.""  

### The Mind's Game: Why It's Not Your Fault
The worst trick trauma plays on you is making you believe you're weak for feeling this way.  

But the truth is...  
Your anxiety isn't random.  
Your fear of abandonment isn't random.  
Your self-hate isn't random.  

They're all survival mechanisms your brain built to protect you when you were too young to understand what was happening.  

The problem is — you're not in that environment anymore... but your brain never got the memo.  

### How Do You Break Free?
Healing childhood trauma isn't just about ""getting over it."" You can't just slap affirmations on top of years of pain and expect to feel whole.  

It's about **reprogramming the beliefs your childhood forced you to adopt** — the ones that tell you you're not enough or that you always have to fight for love.  

Here’s where you start:  

1. **Understand the Patterns:**  
Every self-destructive habit you're struggling with today started as a coping mechanism to survive your childhood. Recognizing this helps you stop blaming yourself and start showing yourself compassion.  

2. **Inner Child Work:**  
The little version of you is still in there — waiting to hear the words they never got. Write them a letter. Tell them they were never too much or not enough.  

3. **Setting Boundaries (Without Guilt):**  
If you grew up walking on eggshells around people, setting boundaries will feel like betrayal at first. But it's not. It's self-respect.  

4. **Self-Forgiveness:**  
Forgive yourself for the ways you coped — even the self-sabotaging ones. You did what you had to do to survive. Now you're learning how to thrive.  

5. **Find the Right Guidance:**  
Healing childhood trauma isn't something you should carry alone. Therapy, books, and safe online communities can help you navigate this journey step by step.  

I recently stumbled upon this **incredibly detailed guide** that breaks down the entire process of overcoming childhood trauma in a way that actually makes sense — without all the sugarcoating.  
If you're feeling lost, I'd genuinely recommend giving it a read:

### This Is Your Sign
If you've made it this far, maybe this post was meant for you. Maybe you've been silently carrying something heavy for years without even realizing how much it's been weighing you down.  

Let this be the moment you finally ask yourself:  

**What if healing is possible for me too?**  

The hardest part isn't the healing itself — it's believing you're worthy of it in the first place.  

You're not broken.  
You're not too far gone.  
You're just finally ready to meet the version of yourself who was buried underneath all that pain.  

Take the first step — even if you're scared.  
Even if you feel like you don't deserve it yet.

1j8donj,anxietyhelp,2025-03-11 00:09:47,Feeling Good,"I went through a bad health anxiety episode two years ago from migraines and headaches. Since then I have been a mess and most days have felt like hell. Constant rumination, headaches, weird burning pains, and an overall feeling of dread and feeling unsettled. I didn’t even think the human mind could feel this bad just from anxiety.

I became obsessed with trying to get back to my normal self. I’ve spent over $400 on supplements, thousands on doctor visits, medications, therapy,
read a ton of literature about it, and other natural remedies like mindfulness and meditation.

I’m finally found the right medication after trying meds like Prozac, Zoloft, buspar, gabapenton, pregabalin, Xanax, klonapin, and thyroid meds. From that list only the benzo’s helped and I was too afraid to take them consistently. I eventually got prescribed a medication called Notriptyline. Slowly but surely I noticed I wasn’t obsessing and my head started to feel better. My starting dose was 10mg and now currently on 50mg. I feel better with zero to little anxiety and my motivation to do things is much higher than even before the anxiety disorder. It probably helped some depression I didn’t even know I had. I sometimes can’t believe how good I feel from the terrible state I was in.

From all the natural anxiety books I read the main point was to focus on life and accept the anxiety. But when you’re in constant anguish daily for two years giving it your best shot and nothing really improves I think medication is the only possible route. 

My point is keep trying don’t give up. Try the natural rout first and if you see no positive results after a while look toward medication. It took trying over seven different medicines to find the right one. Good luck and just know even on your darkest days this is temporary. You will eventually find something that works you just need to keep trying!",8,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxietyhelp/comments/1j8donj/feeling_good/,Feeling Good went bad health anxiety episode two years ago migraines headaches Since mess days felt like hell Constant rumination headaches weird burning pains overall feeling dread feeling unsettled didnt even think human mind could feel bad anxiety became obsessed trying get back normal self Ive spent 400 supplements thousands doctor visits medications therapy read ton literature natural remedies like mindfulness meditation Im finally found right medication trying meds like Prozac Zoloft buspar gabapenton pregabalin Xanax klonapin thyroid meds list benzos helped afraid take consistently eventually got prescribed medication called Notriptyline Slowly surely noticed wasnt obsessing head started feel better starting dose 10mg currently 50mg feel better zero little anxiety motivation things much higher even anxiety disorder probably helped depression didnt even know sometimes cant believe good feel terrible state natural anxiety books read main point focus life accept anxiety youre constant anguish daily two years giving best shot nothing really improves think medication possible route point keep trying dont give Try natural rout first see positive results look toward medication took trying seven different medicines find right one Good luck know even darkest days temporary eventually find something works need keep trying

Everything was normal for about a week. Decided to start smoking again, which caused me to have a panic attack. That was even worse. it’s just kind of random how it happened. I was smoking the day before and that entire day up until about 11 o’clock at night when I got another panic attack. This one was a lot worse lasted for about an hour and a half two hours I’ve been dealing with the symptoms ever since slight deep realization not as bad just kind of like a little foggy my memories gotten better like when it comes to short term stuff I had really bad shortness of breath for the last three weeks. It’s gotten slightly better where I can take that satisfying breath, maybe one and every three times depending on the time of the day, but my heart rate is still elevated blood pressure dropped since the first week from 135 to around 120 Ish so again I guess there’s a little improvement but I still feel like there’s this days over everything that I do day-to-day really hard to focus takes me like an extra second to like really focus on things just was kinda looking to see how people‘s recovery have been is it day by day it gets better.

Just reaching out and wondering if any of you have experienced this? 

I have been living with anxiety and depression (and potentially some undiagnosed OCD) for about 10/15 years now. It can spike during particularly stressful periods of my life but I manage it without meds and with exercise, therapy etc

I have been going through one of those shittier times for the last 2 months and out of nowhere I experienced 5 days of peace. No intrusive thoughts. No anxious thoughts or anxious bodily sensations. I felt normal and my mind felt quiet for the first time in ages. My parents even noticed the change in my mood and demeanour.

Then I had some stressful stuff going on and boom, back to where I was before. A tonne of anxiety and feeling horrendous.

In hindsight those 5 days were so blissful yet in a way, have now made life feel worse since I experienced what feeling ‘normal’ for me is like and just how shitty I feel when my anxiety is the way it is rn.

Please tell me some positive stories about getting back to feeling like yourself again. I definitely need some hope and positivity right now :(",8,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxietyhelp/comments/1j3p5ea/peaceful_mind_for_first_time_in_months/,Peaceful mind first time months Hi reaching wondering experienced living anxiety depression potentially undiagnosed OCD 1015 years spike particularly stressful periods life manage without meds exercise therapy etc going one shittier times last 2 months nowhere experienced 5 days peace intrusive thoughts anxious thoughts anxious bodily sensations felt normal mind felt quiet first time ages parents even noticed change mood demeanour stressful stuff going boom back tonne anxiety feeling horrendous hindsight 5 days blissful yet way made life feel worse since experienced feeling normal like shitty feel anxiety way rn Please tell positive stories getting back feeling like definitely need hope positivity right

I genuinely thought maybe it was an embolism or heart attack cause while I believed to have had panic attacks in the past this shit was something else.

1j9s48g,anxietyhelp,2025-03-12 19:10:30,"10 Anxiety Relief Tips, Resources & Hacks That Actually Work (From Someone Who’s Been There)","Hey everyone,  

If you’re reading this, there’s a good chance you’re feeling anxious right now—or you’ve been struggling with it for a while. I get it. Anxiety is exhausting. It makes your heart race over things that *should* be simple. It makes you overthink every conversation, every text message, every decision. It makes you feel like you’re constantly running from an invisible threat.  

I’ve been in that place where anxiety took over my life, where I couldn’t breathe without questioning if something was wrong with me. But here’s what I’ve learned: **Anxiety doesn’t define you, and it doesn’t have to control you.**  

So, I’m sharing **10 anxiety relief tips, resources, and hacks** that have actually made a difference for me. Some are unconventional. Some are backed by science. All of them are things I wish someone had told me sooner.  

### **1. The 5-4-3-2-1 Grounding Technique**  
When anxiety spikes, your thoughts feel like a tornado. This exercise forces your brain to focus on the present:  
- **5 things you can see**  
- **4 things you can touch**  
- **3 things you can hear**  
- **2 things you can smell**  
- **1 thing you can taste**  

It sounds simple, but it *interrupts* the anxiety loop and brings you back to reality.  

### **2. The “Name It to Tame It” Hack**  
Ever notice how your anxiety gets worse when you try to ignore it? Neuroscientist Dan Siegel coined this strategy: **when you name your emotions, they lose their grip on you.** Next time anxiety hits, say out loud:  

*""I’m feeling anxious because _____. But this feeling will pass.""*  

### **3. Anxiety and Blood Sugar Are Besties (In a Bad Way)**  
Here’s a secret most people don’t know: **Low blood sugar mimics anxiety.** Shaky hands, racing heart, dizziness? That could be **hunger**—not a panic attack. Try eating a snack with protein + fat (like almonds or peanut butter toast) before assuming the worst.  

### **4. The 3-Minute “Ice Hack” for Panic Attacks**  
Cold exposure **shocks your nervous system out of fight-or-flight mode.** Next time panic creeps in, grab an ice pack, splash cold water on your face, or dunk your hands in ice water. It forces your body to slow your heart rate and reset your breathing.  

### **5. The “Anxiety Is a Liar” Reminder**  
Anxiety makes everything feel like a life-or-death situation. But 99% of the time? **It’s lying to you.** Keep a sticky note somewhere visible that says:  

*""Anxiety is a false alarm. I am safe. I’ve survived every anxious thought before—this one is no different.""*  

### **6. The “Anxiety Playlist” Trick**  
Music can change your entire physiological state. Make two playlists:  
- **One with calming, slow-tempo music** (for grounding)  
- **One with empowering, energetic songs** (for when you need a boost)  

Put on your headphones and let your nervous system sync to the rhythm.  

### **7. The “Box Breathing” Navy SEAL Method**  
When elite soldiers need to stay calm in high-stress situations, they use *box breathing*:  
- Inhale for 4 seconds  
- Hold for 4 seconds  
- Exhale for 4 seconds  
- Hold for 4 seconds  

Try it for 1-2 minutes, and feel the tension melt away.  

### **8. The 10-10-10 Rule for Overthinking**  
Anxiety loves to trap you in a spiral of **“what ifs.”** When you’re stuck overanalyzing, ask yourself:  
- **Will this matter in 10 minutes?**  
- **Will this matter in 10 days?**  
- **Will this matter in 10 years?**  

Most of the time, the answer is no—and that realization can be freeing.  

### **9. The “Brain Dump” Nighttime Routine**  
If anxiety keeps you awake, try this: **Grab a notebook and write down every anxious thought before bed.** It doesn’t have to make sense. Just get it *out* of your head. This signals to your brain that it’s safe to sleep because nothing will be forgotten.  

### **10. The Ultimate Anxiety Relief Bundle (Lifesaver!)**  
I wish I had this when I was at my worst: **[The Ultimate Anxiety Relief Bundle](https://www.anxietysupports.com/p/the-ultimate-anxiety-relief-bundle/6786cf4841f276dbe2af04d1)**.  

It’s packed with expert resources, workbooks, and practical tools that actually help. If you’re looking for **real strategies** (not just “take deep breaths” advice), it’s worth checking out.

### **Final Thoughts (From Someone Who’s Been There)**  
If anxiety has been making your life feel unbearable, I need you to hear this: **You’re not broken. You’re not alone. And you’re not stuck this way forever.**  

Healing isn’t instant, but **small steps add up.** Try one of these hacks today. See what helps. And if nothing else, remember:

1j6m8to,anxietyhelp,2025-03-08 17:33:54,I don't know if I can keep going like this...,"Hey, I just need some support or words of advice. I have health anxiety, probably panic disorder, idk, everything feels bad!

In December I had a weird health* thing that left me housebound and almost bedbound. It was diagnosed as sinusitis, but the antibiotics didn't seem to do anything. *(Jury is still out on what the hell happened to me, but I was dizzy and nauseous at random times, head pressure, nose pressure, felt like I couldn't do anything. It could have been anxiety)

Then I had an awful anxiety episode that spanned like 4 hours on New Years. And everything just kept getting worse. I found the podcast Disordered who really helped me get back into living a bit, but I was still dragging myself through life for two months basically, unemployed, only thing I loved doing was the gym.

The real deep pit for me is right now. Over two weeks ago I tried Buspirone and it made me incredibly nauseous and anxious which made me spiral, then about a week later I came down with a cold. Obviously unable to workout, my life for 9 days now has become a total wreck, that feels like it's going to be forever. 

Three days ago I started taking Mirtazapine, bc I had taken it years prior and seemed to do ok with, but now I've been incredibly dizzy every day I've taken it to the point where I had to sit down and discontinue whatever I was doing for the rest of the evening. I feel this awful head pressure on my temples and in my ears and I get random vertigo and nausea. It's REALLY bringing me back to December. I'm so scared that this medication won't work or that this is my body breaking down in some way.

TL;DR: Health anxiety + long episode of dizziness and head pressure a few months ago. Got a bad cold, sent me spiraling for a bit, three days ago I started taking Mirtazapine and it's  giving me dizziness, vertigo and head pressure, which makes me panic that it will be the same as last time (housebound/bedbound for a month)

1j4bk4i,anxietyhelp,2025-03-05 19:28:43,Ancient Remedies for Anxiety That Still Work Today (and How to Blend Them Into Modern Life),"Hey everyone,  

I know what it's like to feel like your mind is at war with itself — that endless loop of worry, the constant tension in your chest, the fear that you're never fully safe or in control. Anxiety can make us feel like we're alone in our struggle... but what if I told you that people have been battling these same feelings for thousands of years?  

Our ancestors didn't have SSRIs or therapy apps — but they still found ways to ease their anxious minds. And the crazy part? Many of those ancient remedies still *work* today, maybe even better than what modern medicine offers.  

I’ve spent the last few months deep-diving into forgotten remedies from different cultures, not out of curiosity — but out of desperation. Modern life feels like it’s speeding up every year, and I think a lot of us are silently breaking under the pressure. I wanted something... simpler. Something that could ground me without needing to pop a pill or wait six months for a therapy appointment.  

What I found honestly changed the way I see anxiety — and I want to share it with anyone who's feeling lost right now.  

### 1. **Ashwagandha (The Ancient Chill Pill)**
Used in Ayurvedic medicine for over 3,000 years, this adaptogenic herb literally helps your body adapt to stress. Modern studies show it lowers cortisol levels — the same stress hormone that makes your heart race and your mind spiral.  

👉 How to Use It Today: Take it in capsule form, or if you're into rituals, brew a small cup of warm milk with a teaspoon of ashwagandha powder before bed. It feels like a hug from the inside out.  

---

### 2. **Meditative Breathing from Zen Monks (The Original Anxiety Hack)**
In ancient Japan, monks would practice **""Zazen""** — a simple breathing technique where you inhale slowly, hold, exhale even slower... and repeat. The trick is making the exhale longer than the inhale, which literally signals your nervous system that you're safe.  

👉 How to Use It Today: Try the **4-7-8 method** (inhale for 4, hold for 7, exhale for 8). I swear this works better than any anxiety medication I've ever tried.  

---

### 3. **Lavender Oil (Nature's Xanax)**
The ancient Greeks and Romans used lavender to calm the mind and even treat insomnia. Modern science backs this up — lavender oil literally interacts with the same receptors in your brain as anti-anxiety meds like Valium... but without the side effects.  

👉 How to Use It Today: Rub a few drops on your wrists, put it in a diffuser, or even take lavender capsules. I’ve been using this before bed and it’s made my nights feel *so much softer*.  

---

### 4. **Forest Bathing (Japanese Shinrin-Yoku)**
This one kind of broke me when I read about it. The whole idea is just... walking slowly through nature. No phone. No distractions. Just letting the sounds and smells of the forest wrap around you. Japanese doctors literally prescribe this to patients with anxiety — because nature lowers cortisol without us even realizing it.  

👉 How to Use It Today: If you don't live near a forest, even sitting in a park for 20 minutes can reset your whole nervous system.  

---

### 5. **Mantras + Affirmations (Ancient Self-Talk Therapy)**
Ancient cultures knew something we forgot — the way you talk to yourself *creates* your reality. In Hindu traditions, repeating certain mantras like **""Om Mani Padme Hum""** was believed to cleanse the mind of negativity.  

👉 How to Use It Today: Create your own personal mantra. Mine has been:  
*""I am safe. This feeling will pass.""*  
I repeat it under my breath whenever I feel panic rising — and somehow... it works.  

---

### Why These Remedies Work Better Than You Think
I think a lot of us (myself included) have been tricked into thinking we need something **external** to fix us — medication, productivity hacks, endless self-help books... But anxiety isn't just a modern problem. It's a *human* problem.  

What if the real cure isn't something new... but something really, really old?  

---

### How to Blend Ancient Remedies into Modern Life
I'm not saying throw away your meds or cancel your therapy sessions — I still believe those things can help. But maybe what we're missing is the balance.  

- Start your morning with lavender oil on your wrists instead of doomscrolling.  
- Take 5 minutes in the afternoon to do breathing exercises instead of reaching for caffeine.  
- End your day with ashwagandha tea and a mantra instead of Netflix and TikTok.  

---

### If You're Struggling Right Now...
I know how hard it is to climb out of anxiety when it feels like you're trapped inside your own mind. I've been there — I *am* there.  

But I genuinely believe there’s a softer way to heal. It’s not about forcing yourself to ""think positive"" or waiting for life to get easier. It’s about creating little pockets of peace inside the chaos.  

If you're looking for something to guide you through that process — this **[Ultimate Anxiety Relief Bundle](https://www.anxietysupports.com/p/the-ultimate-anxiety-relief-bundle/6786cf4841f276dbe2af04d1)** honestly helped me so much. It's full of ancient techniques + modern tips that actually feel... human. Not clinical. Not like someone trying to sell you a miracle cure.  

---

### Final Thoughts
I don't have all the answers — but I feel like I'm starting to *remember* what my body already knows. That healing isn't about numbing the bad feelings... it's about learning how to *hold them* without breaking.  

If you're reading this and feel even a little spark of hope — please don't ignore it. That spark is proof you're still alive. You're still trying. You're not broken.  

You're just human — like every single person who's ever walked this earth before you.  

What ancient remedies or small rituals have helped your anxiety? I'd honestly love to hear what keeps you going.  

Let's build a little time capsule of healing together.

1j1d7wr,anxietyhelp,2025-03-01 23:43:27,I have mostly conquered my anxiety but I feel great sadness for my wasted youth,"When I was a teenager I had social anxiety and general anxiety really bad. I would overthink everything and be afraid to express my feelings. I felt embarrassed for ever having negative emotions and felt like no one cared what I think. I would get panic attacks just trying to make a phone call. I thought I was ugly and would never have an intimate relationship. I struggled to feel present - “in the moment” - like all my peers could do so easily. It was like everyone understood life better than I did. 

When I was 22 I finally got a diagnosis and a prescription. 

Now I’m 30 and my anxiety symptoms are very minimal. I’m not on any meds and have good coping mechanisms. I have an active social life, close friends, and a loving partner. But so much of my mind is preoccupied with feeling sorry for my younger self. I get sad every time I think about moments in my past when my crippling anxiety denied me positive experiences. It’s time I will never get back. These thoughts of regret and “what ifs” constantly pop into my head whenever I’m not doing something to distract me.

First I thought I had a PE in my lungs because my back hurt but that’s resolved now. I guess it was trapped gas from surgery? And then it was me thinking I had an infection on my incision. Nope incision are supposed to look the way mine does. Then I have had this headache for 6 days now. So I went to the ER. The ruled out anything bad and even did an MRI. The MRI only found “Slightly low-lying left cerebellar tonsil protruding 3 mm below the foramen magnum.”. Which isn’t a concern at all to them and they don’t think it’s why I have a headache. And then while at the ER I was looking at my vitals and say my pulse ox go down to 89% like 3 times! And that caused me to panic cause what??? Why would it go down that low. When I brought it up to the dr they didn’t even seem concerned especially because I have no symptoms to
Indicate there’s something wrong. They also said sometimes it can give false readings especially if I was sweating or something and I def was. And it was one of the disposable ones and I had taken it off a few times for some tests. So maybe that also messed it up. I then went to look at my records on my phone and saw that my pulse ox has dropped to 91% before in the past. Which sorta reassured me. Yeah idk why my anxiety has been SO bad lately.

1jeseu3,anxietyhelp,2025-03-19 08:38:49,Can these symptoms actually be anxiety? 16f,"(This first paragraph probably isn't too important so feel free to skip)

So I've been struggling with sudden health anxiety the moment I turned 14 (most likely inherited). I'm ALWAYS in a constant state of panic no matter what, even if my anxiety isn't necessarily high in the moment I'm always a little bit on edge and alert. A little more than a week ago my mom started experiencing issues with her heart and that's made me EXTREMELY anxious. I found out she just has a flutter and she's most likely going to be okay and just needs her heart 'shocked' back to normal. However I keep getting anxious about my own heart, and every single little symptom I have, even if it's normal. It got to a point where I had 4 panic attacks in 3 days. Here's what I'm now experiencing, or have experienced:

•racing heart (especially when I focus on it)
•slight dizziness
•constantly feeling a little off balance
•chronic fatigue (sometimes it's hard to even keep my eyes open)
•waking up in the middle of the night with sudden, extreme panic and a fast heart rate
•hot/cold flashes
•constant urge to urinate
•GI issues (either constantly having to poopor constipated, nausea, loss of appetite, stomach hurting after eating even if I didn't eat a lot)
•heartburn
•excessive salivation (not drooling)
•a general sense of feeling unwell or flu like

1jasfd5,anxietyhelp,2025-03-14 01:26:23,Can’t get rid of the symptoms?,"34 year old male who never really had what I believe is anxiety up until a little over a year ago.

All within a month December of 2023..
 -I found out my wife and I were having our first child.  
-Two weeks later my dad had a stroke.
-Christmas.
-NYE my wife being pregnant we left early and we were almost killed by a wrong way driver.  We didn’t see it but she killed the driver of the car behind us.

About 5 days after the NYE incident I sort of lost it for three days.  Crippling anxiety, depression, suicidal thoughts and no sleep for most of the three days….Ive never experienced anything like it but it changed my life forever.

I immediately got myself into therapy and with time and hard work I feel like I have largely suppressed most of it but I struggle with a few more symptoms.

-Head Pain ALWAYS on the right side.  It doesn’t necessarily hurt, but it’s annoying.  When this flares up I feel like I’m cognitively running at 70%.  Sentence structure becomes worse, I can’t focus and I become irritable.

Eyes- Sometimes my eyes will randomly go full bloodshot.  I look like tiger woods in his DUI photo.  My vision feels like I’m at 70% when this happens. 

Not all the time, but sometimes as well but when the right sided head pressure comes my right eye blood vessels will burst, left eye stays the same

Over all of this I have had just about every single scan and test run looking for things like stroke, aneurism and tumors but they all turned up negative.

I have also read from earlier post….this seems to be becoming more common?

1jak1ck,anxietyhelp,2025-03-13 19:11:18,How to Beat Anxiety & Panic Attacks (Even When Life is Already a Mess),"Hey, you. Yeah, you—the one who’s scrolling Reddit at 3 AM, heart pounding, stomach in knots, feeling like your brain is both running a marathon and drowning at the same time. Maybe you’re sitting there thinking:  

*""Great. Anxiety and panic attacks. Just what I needed on top of everything else.""*  

Because let’s be real: life isn’t exactly handing out easy-mode settings. Maybe you’re already dealing with financial stress, a toxic relationship, a health issue, or just the crushing weight of *being a human in this world.*  

And now, anxiety and panic attacks have decided to join the party. Fantastic.  

I get it.  

You’re not just anxious—you’re exhausted. You’re frustrated. You’re **done** with feeling like this. And if you’ve tried everything—breathing techniques, cold showers, distractions—but the panic keeps creeping back, it’s easy to feel hopeless.  

But here’s the thing: **your anxiety is not unbeatable.** It’s not some unmovable force that’s destined to control your life forever. I know because I’ve been where you are. And I got through it.  

So, let’s talk about *real* ways to break this cycle. No vague “just think positive” nonsense. No miracle cures. Just practical, battle-tested ways to start reclaiming your mind.  

---

### **Step 1: Stop Fighting the Panic**  
Wait, what? I know that sounds counterintuitive, but hear me out.  

Panic attacks feed off resistance. The more you fight them, the stronger they get. Instead of trying to “make it stop,” try this:  

- **Acknowledge it.** Literally say (either out loud or in your head), *“I see you, panic. You’re here.”*  
- **Let it pass.** Instead of freaking out about how it feels, just observe it like a scientist. “Oh, my heart is racing. My hands are sweaty. Interesting.”  
- **Remind yourself: It always ends.** You have survived *every* panic attack before. You will survive this one.  

When you stop fearing the fear, it loses its grip.  

---

### **Step 2: Find the Real Root Cause**  
Anxiety is usually a symptom of something deeper. It’s not random. Ask yourself:  

- What’s been *really* bothering me lately?  
- Am I ignoring a problem I need to face?  
- Is my body trying to tell me something? (Lack of sleep, poor diet, burnout, etc.)  

Sometimes, anxiety is your mind’s way of screaming for attention—begging you to address something you've been avoiding. And if you keep trying to ""fix"" the anxiety without fixing the *cause,* it’ll just keep coming back.  

---

### **Step 3: Make Small, Low-Effort Wins**  
When life is already overwhelming, the last thing you need is a 20-step morning routine that requires meditating on a mountain. Instead, try **low-effort wins** that trick your brain into feeling calmer:  

✅ **Move your body.** Not a workout—just *move*. Walk around your room. Stretch. Jump in place. Shake off the tension.   
✅ **Cold water on your face.** It triggers your vagus nerve, which instantly calms your nervous system.  
✅ **Box breathing:** Inhale for 4 seconds → Hold for 4 → Exhale for 4 → Hold for 4. Repeat.  
✅ **Talk to yourself like you would a friend.** If a friend was struggling, you wouldn’t say “You’re so weak.” You’d say, “You’re doing your best.” Try saying it to *yourself.*  

The goal here isn’t to “cure” anxiety overnight—it’s to send little signals to your brain that **you’re safe.**  

---

### **Step 4: Learn How to Retrain Your Brain**  
This is the part that changed everything for me. Anxiety is like a broken alarm system—it keeps going off even when there’s no real danger. The good news? **You can rewire it.**  

I stumbled across something that helped me do exactly that. It wasn’t therapy (though therapy is great). It wasn’t meds (though those help some people). It was a **science-backed** approach to understanding and dismantling anxiety at its core.  

I won’t go into a full sales pitch, but if you want to check it out, it’s called [The Anxiety Bundle](https://anxietybundle.com/). It’s got expert-backed resources that actually make a difference—no fluff, no fake promises. If you're tired of the same old advice that doesn't work, it's worth a look.  

---

### **Final Thoughts (For When It Feels Impossible)**  
I know what you’re thinking.  

*""Yeah, yeah, this all sounds great—but what if I’m different? What if nothing ever works for me?""*  

That’s anxiety talking. It *wants* you to believe you’re stuck. That you’re beyond help. That your life will always feel like this.  

But that’s a lie.  

Because I promise you: **you are not broken.**  
You are not weak.  
You are not hopeless.  

You’re just **a person who’s been fighting too long without the right tools.** And now, you’re starting to find them.  

So, take a breath. Take a step. Even a tiny one. Because **this doesn’t have to be your forever.**  

And I’ll be right here if you need to talk.

But I'm also someone who uses strict evidence to combat my own overthinking mind. Start to really worry about something? Present evidence based counterpoint to myself. It works for the big stuff, but the problem is I can't relax. So I just feel it all building up and taking an overall toll.There are all these common fixes for alleviating stress and anxiety. Be active, eat better. Yeah I do that. Have for years. Don't see much difference. All these methods I find online are so nebulous or wishy washy I can't make it work for me. Cause I think these articles are just making things up.

So a long way of asking, is there legit evidence based research on how to relax? Like research on provable methods of ejecting the brain chemicals responsible for stress and anxiety?

I have nothing going for me and anxiety and depression are also making it even worse because whenever i try to do anything to make changes im either too anxious whilst taking the action to continue or see no hope in the end result as i feel like id still be a loser at the end of it. The one good thing that happened in my life was because my sister was with me but even through that i could have done better had i not been hopeless and anxious. Most of the advice is not to believe what your brain is saying and to be more mindful but i feel like all that does is get me more stuck especially when there are ongoing issues that need a fix right now. Im not sure if this rambling mess makes sense to anyone.

I started back on my zoloft about 3 weeks ago so Im hoping it will start helping soon. 50mg. I cannot stop thinking I have colon cancer. And last month it was blood cancer. This all started from some abnormal blood tests I got done last month. My platelets were high so immediately Im googling everything possible and bam there goes the C word. So it stuck, naturally. And blood cancer? One of the rarest? I probably don’t have it ya know? But what if? Idk. I went back a week later to get more blood work because I couldnt sleep. My platelets were back to normal but then my white blood count was high so bam thinking cancer again. I stopped thinking about it as much until my mom mentioned colon cancer a couple weeks back. My mom suffers with health anxiety too and is on the same dose of zoloft as me. But it doesn’t help that everyday she thinks she has cancer too. So naturally I started googling the symptoms for colon cancer…and Idk if it’s just my brain tricking me or the anxiety making my stomach turn, but I swear my bowel movements have been weird. Like twice a day and I dont normally poop so much. My partner says I do poop a lot but I swear it doesn’t feel like Ive ever pooped so much. And sometimes it’s hard pebbles sometimes it’s loose. Like Im freaking out! And Im giving myself every symptom in the book because Im always tired oh and my iron levels are high also and that can also be an indicator of cancer like ugh. My uncle (not blood related) was diagnosed with bone cancer not that long ago and I saw him a month ago maybe it’s contributing to my anxiety? I made another appointment and my primary care doctor actually referred me herself to the hematology/oncology department so that doesn’t help me get a peace of mind.

1jhfklp,anxietyhelp,2025-03-22 18:48:03,How Food Plays a Vital Role in Anxiety (And How to Take Care of Your Diet),"#### **You Are What You Eat—And So Is Your Anxiety**

Have you ever noticed how certain meals leave you feeling sluggish, irritable, or even on edge, while others seem to calm your mind and uplift your mood? That’s not a coincidence. What you eat directly impacts your brain chemistry, hormone levels, and even your resilience to anxiety. 

But here’s the thing most people overlook: anxiety isn't *just* in your head—it’s in your gut, your bloodstream, and your nervous system. And your diet is the fuel that keeps the whole machine running smoothly… or causes it to malfunction.

If you’ve been struggling with anxiety, it’s time to ask yourself: **Is my diet making it worse?**  
The connection between food and anxiety is **more powerful than you think**, and in this post, I’ll break it down in a way that makes it *click*—emotionally and practically.

---

### 💡 **The Gut-Brain Connection: Why Your Stomach Holds the Key to a Calmer Mind**

You’ve probably heard the saying, *“Trust your gut.”* Well, it turns out that your gut does a lot more than just digest food—it has a *direct line to your brain* through the **vagus nerve**. This connection is so strong that your gut is often referred to as your **“second brain.”**

Here’s why this matters:  
- Your gut produces **90% of your serotonin**, the ""feel-good"" neurotransmitter responsible for regulating mood.  
- When your gut microbiome (the bacteria in your digestive system) is out of balance due to poor diet, it can lead to **inflammation**—which has been linked to **increased anxiety and depression**.  
- Ever felt “butterflies in your stomach” when you’re nervous? That’s your gut-brain connection in action. 

Now, imagine your gut being constantly irritated by **processed foods, sugar, and artificial additives**. The result? Your brain receives distress signals, worsening anxiety symptoms.

---

### 🍎 **The Foods That Fuel Anxiety (You Need to Cut These Out)**  

Many people unknowingly sabotage their mental health with the foods they eat daily. Here are the biggest culprits:  

1. **Refined Sugar & Simple Carbs:**  
   - Sugar may give you a temporary high, but the crash that follows triggers irritability, fatigue, and anxiety spikes.  
   - Pastries, candy, soda, and even ""healthy"" granola bars can be anxiety triggers in disguise.  

2. **Caffeine Overload:**  
   - That third cup of coffee you rely on? It’s likely **raising your cortisol levels**, making you feel jittery and on edge.  
   - Caffeine also disrupts sleep, which is a *massive* anxiety trigger.  

3. **Ultra-Processed Foods:**  
   - Chips, frozen meals, and fast food contain **preservatives, trans fats, and artificial flavors** that inflame the gut and brain.  
   - These foods impair your body’s ability to regulate stress hormones.  

4. **Alcohol:**  
   - While it may offer temporary relaxation, alcohol **depletes serotonin** and disrupts sleep cycles, creating a vicious cycle of heightened anxiety.  

---

### 🥗 **The Anxiety-Reducing Diet: Food That Calms Your Mind**  

Now for the good news: you can actively **reduce your anxiety** through food. Here’s what you should prioritize:  

✅ **Magnesium-Rich Foods:**  
   - Magnesium plays a critical role in **relaxing the nervous system**.  
   - Add **spinach, pumpkin seeds, almonds, and dark chocolate** to your diet.  

✅ **Omega-3 Fatty Acids:**  
   - Omega-3s reduce inflammation and **improve brain function**, helping to stabilize mood.  
   - Eat more **salmon, walnuts, flaxseeds, and chia seeds**.  

✅ **Complex Carbohydrates:**  
   - Unlike simple carbs, complex carbs release glucose slowly, providing steady energy and promoting serotonin production.  
   - Think **oats, quinoa, sweet potatoes, and whole grains**.  

✅ **Fermented Foods:**  
   - These boost your gut health, supporting the production of anxiety-calming neurotransmitters.  
   - Include **yogurt, kimchi, sauerkraut, and kefir** in your meals.  

✅ **Hydrating, Whole Foods:**  
   - Dehydration worsens anxiety symptoms. Stay hydrated with **water-rich foods** like cucumbers, watermelon, and citrus fruits.

### 🧠 **How to Eat Your Way Out of Anxiety (Actionable Tips)**  

1. **Meal Prep with Intention:**  
   - Plan meals around **whole foods** instead of relying on takeout or packaged items.  
   - Batch-cook healthy snacks like trail mix (nuts + seeds) or veggie sticks with hummus.  

2. **Adopt the 80/20 Rule:**  
   - Aim for **80% nutrient-dense foods** and allow 20% for indulgences.  
   - This prevents guilt and promotes sustainable eating habits.  

3. **Stay Consistent with Meal Times:**  
   - Skipping meals or erratic eating patterns causes **blood sugar drops**, which worsen anxiety.  
   - Stick to **regular meal times** to stabilize energy and mood.

### 💬 **Real Talk: Your Diet Is a Form of Self-Love**  

I know changing your diet isn’t easy, especially if you’ve used food for comfort during anxious moments. But here’s the truth:  
- The **instant gratification** of junk food isn't worth the **long-term anxiety spikes**.  
- Nourishing your body is one of the **most empowering ways** to regain control over your mental health.  

You *deserve* to feel calm, centered, and free from the grip of anxiety. And while food isn’t a magic bullet, it **lays the foundation** for emotional stability.

1jfk1x4,anxietyhelp,2025-03-20 08:17:43,Panic attacks and panic disorder,"Hello Redditors,

About one year ago I had my first panic attack while I was in my car. I rushed home and told my parents to drive me to ER. From there it started... 

For a year now I have been to ER 5 times, I had all the check ups (heart multiple times, lungs, stomach, brain, allergies) but I came to conclusion that is just panic attacks and I will not die. I went to psychologist but he did not help me much. I went to psychiatrist  and he told me that I should use medication and I didnt because I am afraid of the aftermath and any addictions that may come up.

So I tried to do things alone.. 

I tried to control my breathing (5 sec in and 5 sec out, this was proposed by the psychiatrist), I tried to go out for walks, I quit smoking, I reduced alcohol ( I only drink now 1-2 times per month) and it worked....kinda...

For 1-2 months I was ok and 2 weeks before, I started going to the gym. I went 3 times and suddenly... a panic attack. From this day and for 1 week now I feel terrible, my stomach is in pain again, when I ride the subway I think I will pass out and when I go home I just want to sleep and wake up tired..

My work is not so anxious, I live with my GF now and everything run smooth, I do not do drugs and I enjoy life as much as I can. I try to be a better person overall. But I struggle with this thing.. real struggle.

I need some advice on this...

Thanks",3,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxietyhelp/comments/1jfk1x4/panic_attacks_and_panic_disorder/,Panic attacks panic disorder Hello Redditors one year ago first panic attack car rushed home told parents drive ER started year ER 5 times check ups heart multiple times lungs stomach brain allergies came conclusion panic attacks die went psychologist help much went psychiatrist told use medication didnt afraid aftermath addictions may come tried things alone tried control breathing 5 sec 5 sec proposed psychiatrist tried go walks quit smoking reduced alcohol drink 12 times per month workedkinda 12 months ok 2 weeks started going gym went 3 times suddenly panic attack day 1 week feel terrible stomach pain ride subway think pass go home want sleep wake tired work anxious live GF everything run smooth drugs enjoy life much try better person overall struggle thing real struggle need advice Thanks

I am 29F and have been diagnosed with depression, anxiety, and ADHD in the past. I haven’t managed to make it to a professional the past few years so I’m no longer medicated and haven’t been evaluated for agoraphobia yet. 
However, I have probably only went outside of my house ~5-10 times in the past 2-3ish years… it’s hard for me to keep track of things when all I do is hide from society and try to pretend I no longer exist 🤦🏼‍♀️. 

Any advice on how to stop procrastinating and freaking out would be great. I would like to look into finding a support group or something. Feel free to send me info if you know of any. ❤️


I’m not exactly sure why I decided to post here today… I might just be hoping venting a little about my thoughts might lessen the impending doom feeling I have? 🤷🏼‍♀️

I need to renew my drivers license and it’s causing me to stress a lot about being able to manage to leave the house to start with, and then miraculously put myself together enough to get my picture taken.. 😅 I know this is silly, but I feel like the picture is going to be terrible and that I’m going to look old and that will make me sad. I know I haven’t been taking care of myself the way I should and I have so many things I’d like to do before I go and that makes me worry that I might not go at all. 😔 


I have had 6 months to do this and I’m down to 2 days remaining before I will have to retake a drivers test, which I am well aware will be way worse. I haven’t actually driven my car in about 2 years anyways… but I’d like to get better at some point soon and still have the option to drive myself places when that happens…


I almost always isolate myself and basically only interact with the man I live with. I might randomly send one text to a friend or something, but then I’ll go MIA for months at a time… I just don’t really have anyone to talk to about this that understands it at all… I mean I really don’t even understand why the fuck I’m like this. I hate that I let myself get to this point. 😐

1jdpam3,anxietyhelp,2025-03-17 22:07:49,Panic attack unlike anything I’ve ever experienced,"Hi! I’m a 26F and I’ve struggled with anxiety/panic attacks since I was 10. Today was something I’ve never experienced before. I wanted to see if anyone else can relate to this. I started to feel pins and needles throughout my whole body mainly my face, arms, hands, legs and feet. As well as my hands/fingers starting to lock up. It started as just my fingers becoming distorting looking and then became fists. I was squeezing so hard my hands became red then turned purple. I’ve felt these symptoms before and know this is common with panic attacks. 
What was new for me was I felt pins and needles inside my mouth and my tongue felt like it was swelling and I actually couldn’t talk! I was thankfully with my husband and once my mouth started doing this it was like I physically could not talk, I was slurring my words and my throat felt like it was closing in and like I was going to start choking on my tongue. I couldn’t open my mouth fully to talk to say what was happening. Then I lost control of being able to open my eyes because I was squeezing them shut, it felt like my body was fighting against itself. Once I was able to open my eyes they wouldn’t stop twitching. Both eyes at the same time, both eyelids and under eyes just uncontrollably twitching. 
Thankfully my husband was able to help me do breathing exercises and help me open my eyes/hands. This all took about 35/40 minutes. My body feels extremely sore. Can anyone relate to any of this? Is this normal for panic attacks?

1jcs2ty,anxietyhelp,2025-03-16 18:28:04,Most Effective Anxiety Tips by Experts That Changed Lives – And How They Can Help You Too,"I know why you're here.  

You’re probably reading this because anxiety has taken over parts of your life that once felt normal. Maybe your chest tightens out of nowhere, your thoughts spiral at 2 AM, or the simplest tasks feel overwhelming. I get it. And so do thousands—millions—of others who have walked this path.  

The good news? There are proven, expert-backed strategies that have *actually* worked for people, transforming their lives in ways they never thought possible. I want to share some of the most powerful ones with you. Because you deserve to feel peace again.  

### 1. **Name It to Tame It – The Neuroscientific Trick**  
One of the simplest but most powerful techniques comes from neuroscience: labeling your emotions.  

When you’re anxious, say to yourself, **“I feel anxious.”** Sounds basic, right? But studies show that labeling emotions reduces activity in the amygdala (the brain’s fear center) and helps engage the rational part of your brain. This is how people go from **feeling consumed by anxiety to feeling in control.**  

👉 **How it changed lives:** A friend of mine, who once had panic attacks so severe she couldn’t leave the house, started practicing this. Within weeks, she noticed the panic didn’t hit as hard. It didn’t own her anymore.  

### 2. **The 5-4-3-2-1 Grounding Method**  
When your mind is racing, this simple exercise helps pull you back into the present:  

- **5** things you see  
- **4** things you touch  
- **3** things you hear  
- **2** things you smell  
- **1** thing you taste  

Why does it work? It shifts your focus from anxious thoughts to *physical reality,* which signals to your nervous system that you're safe.  

👉 **How it changed lives:** A guy I know, who had severe flight anxiety, used this method on his last trip. For the first time in years, he didn’t need medication to get through the flight. He was amazed.  

### 3. **The ""What If?"" Reversal Technique**  
Anxiety loves to ask *“What if something bad happens?”* But what if you flipped it? Instead of **“What if I fail?”** try **“What if I succeed?”**  

👉 **How it changed lives:** A woman struggling with job interview anxiety started using this. Instead of imagining herself freezing up, she pictured herself **acing it.** Her confidence skyrocketed. She landed the job.  

### 4. **Breathing Like a Navy SEAL – Box Breathing**  
Navy SEALs use this technique to stay calm under life-or-death pressure. If it works for them, it works for us:  

- Breathe in for **4** seconds  
- Hold for **4** seconds  
- Exhale for **4** seconds  
- Hold for **4** seconds  
- Repeat  

This slows the heart rate and activates the parasympathetic nervous system, making panic physically impossible.  

👉 **How it changed lives:** A student I met online used this before every exam. He went from failing due to test anxiety to passing with flying colors.  

### 5. **Rewiring the Brain with the “Anxiety Formula”**  
One of the most groundbreaking approaches I’ve come across is **[The Anxiety Formula](https://anxiety-formula.com/)**—a method that helps **retrain your brain** to stop feeding anxiety loops. It’s based on science-backed principles, and real people have seen incredible results.  

👉 **How it changed lives:** I’ve personally spoken to people who struggled for years with crippling anxiety. They tried therapy, meds, and everything else—until they found this approach. For the first time, they felt *real relief.* If nothing has worked for you so far, it’s worth checking out.  

### Final Thought: Anxiety Doesn’t Have to Win  
You don’t have to accept anxiety as your “normal.” People who once felt broken have reclaimed their lives. So can you. **Try one of these techniques today**—even just one—and see what happens.  

And if you want to take a deeper dive into a proven system that’s worked for many, check out **[The Anxiety Formula](https://anxiety-formula.com/)**. It might just be the turning point you’ve been looking for.

1jcqjo7,anxietyhelp,2025-03-16 17:21:51,work commitment anxiety ?,"im having a bit of a problem related to my job and im wondering what this sort of thing could be. 

i recently was promoted in my workplace to a higher role and full time. im very happy about it and i love my job so im looking forward to having more hours. my responsibilities only changed slightly in which ill have to preform a new task, but ill never have to do anything by myself so its no problem. 

everything was fine until today when my boss mentioned that next week ill start getting new hours for full time. after hearing that it felt like something in my brain switched. i felt sick and anxious and almost uncomfortable ?? i didnt wanna do it anymore. this is really unlike me because like i mentioned i LOVE my job and work happily ! so i dont know why i suddenly felt so withdrawn. i feel pretty okay now, and ive thought about it some after my shift and it genuinely is no different than how ive already been working. but i cant help but be bothered by that feeling i had. 

i have had this happen to me before but with a cat i took in. i was so excited and wanted a cat so badly until i got one and then i felt crippling anxiety, dread, and nausea over him until i gave him to a family friend. im wondering if this is related to commitments or something ? its so specific and i cant stand it. i have no plan of leaving my job regardless of my feelings, but i want to be able to deal with this somehow. if anyone has advice or a clue to what i may be feeling that would be incredibly helpful :-))

1jbmo2e,anxietyhelp,2025-03-15 03:58:21,"Anxiety Attacks Leave Me Shaking, Sweating, and Freezing – Any Advice?","I experience sudden anxiety almost every day, mostly in the evening. When it happens, my hands, especially my palms, start shaking. Sometimes they sweat, and I also feel cold, even if the temperature is warm. It’s strange because I get this chilling sensation, like I’m shaking from the cold, but at the same time, I’m sweating. A sudden rise in temperature can also trigger this, making it even worse. I absolutely hate this feeling. It’s the worst.

On top of that, I feel incredibly socially anxious when I’m around people during these moments, which only makes it worse. Let me share a recent example: A few days ago, I was out for dinner with a colleagues when, all of a sudden, anxiety hit. My hands started shaking, and I was doing my best to hide it (not sure if they noticed or not). I kept telling myself to calm down and take deep breaths, but nothing worked—I was literally trembling. Eventually, we stepped outside for a walk, and that’s when I slowly started feeling normal again.

This happens almost every evening. Another example is at work—toward the end of the day, I get the same anxiety. But when I step out of the office, I gradually start feeling better. I guess the fresh air helps. When I’m at home and this happens, especially during summer, I wash my hands and feet with cold water, and that seems to help a bit.

It just comes out of nowhere, and on the days I don’t experience it, I feel like I’m living the best day of my life.

no idea why or how or when, i assume it might have to do something with my medical trauma, since therapists that came to my house to try and fix me, traumatised me BADLY.
it also might be fear of being seen in general, somebody disturbing my peace, my only safe haven - my beloved house.
my fear is that i will faint, which cause my agora. in the first place, where i fainted from an extreme panic attack at the doctors, got taken to the hospital and started avoiding, yada yada.
i ALWAYS fear pasing out infront of somebody and getting taken away again or something happening and me not being able to hide, since i got visitors over.
my birthday is nearing tho and since im FED UP with spending them all alone, i invited my good friend over to my house, to spend the day with me.
as excited as im, im also EXTREMELY anxious, even tho i thought i was doing better by now.

1japxj5,anxietyhelp,2025-03-13 23:24:32,Anxiety onset exclusively after consuming food.,"Although I may not be considered an “anxious” individual, I do not experience random anxiety thoughts. However, I have had some negative past experiences due to health anxiety, which resulted in frequent panic attacks. I was unable to identify the underlying cause and consulted a doctor to assess my heart health. It turned out that my anxiety was manifesting as a constant stream of negative thoughts, affecting my overall well-being. Fortunately, I am gradually recovering, and my nervous system has become remarkably calm. I am uncertain of the cause, but it feels as though someone has reset my nervous system 

I want to share my experience, as I believe it may be helpful to others. I discovered that foods were causing me a significant amount of anxiety. I experience anxiety spikes only immediately after consuming foods or right after eating. I am unsure of the exact connection between food and anxiety, but it seems to be a significant factor. Therefore, I strongly advise individuals with health anxiety or general anxiety to be mindful of their diet and avoid consuming potentially triggering foods.

I apologize for the length of my post, but I felt compelled to share my experience.

As a health anxiety sufferer for more than 15 years I can say that what has helped me the most was the cbt (cognitive behavioral therapy) techniques in the anxiety guy's health anxiety program. I was seriously skeptical to get an online program but other reviews were really good so thought I would give it a go. 

My symptoms are almost completely gone and I used to spend 3 times a week in the doctors/emergency room thinking the absolute worst case scenario. Might I add that at the time I was the lowest I was seeing one of the top notch therapists who didnt really help at all. 

I like how it's practical and step by step. It has helped me to slowly unravel the years of fear and I truly never believed I could have come this far. Its helped get my back life and truly live and I hope it can help others.

1j7tpcd,anxietyhelp,2025-03-10 08:07:42,"My anxiety is so bad I can't even use the restroom in my own house. How can I overcome this? (Not just this specific example, but just in general)","So, sorry if this is a little tmi, but I'll try to avoid the gross details. But let's just say I tend to overhydrate, and I have weak pelvic muscles. (All I do is lay down in my bed all day. Literally. Sometimes I go to school, but thats driving, and sitting in a different location. I get on average 2k-3k steps a day)

For some reason I feel like my family will judge me for literally using the restroom. Like sometimes it'll be 5-10 minutes later, and I have to use it again. But I feel like I need to wait a minimum of 15 minutes so my family doesn't think I'm gross. I know logically they don't care, and their not paying attention. But, still, I can't help but think their secretly thinking I'm some disgusting whelp. 


I also have to wash my hands for 5 minutes. (I set a timer on my phone) and I feel disgusting if I don't. Also, I just hate it when things don't end with a 0 or a 5. So I will usually just wait a few minutes until the time is right. So if it's like 3:12 and I'm done, I will wait 2 minutes. So it's 3:14, so by the time I set up my timer, and start washing my hands it's around 3:15. Which is perfect, because by the time I am done washing my hands it'll be 3:20 which is a good number in my opinion. I do that with almost every other activity I do. It's not a big deal because it's usually just a couple of minutes. I can pretened like it's taking me a long time to put on my shoes, or brush my teeth. When in all reality I'm just sitting there waiting for the clock to end with a 5 or a 0. I can ignore it if most situations, but I will think about how much of a failure I am. Anyway, it's also really boring just washing your hands for that long. And if you use the restroom as often as I do, it leads to my hands becoming dry and uncomfortable. But I need to feel clean, or else I'll need to take a shower. And I'm only allowed 30 minutes of total shower time, which I split up to 2 15 minute showers. Idk. I just feel like I have a grime underneath my skin, and I am actually dirty and disgusting smelling all the time.


And it's extra annoying if I am doing something while I'm waiting for the time to pass, so it'll be at a 5 or a 0, and I miss my safe time. Sometimes if it's bad enough I'll do it, but often or not I end up having to wait another 5 minutes. 


So yeah, that's why it can be a bit of a hassle for me to use the restroom. A trip to just piss takes me up to 10-15 minutes, even if the action itself is less then one.


I tried to start pacing in my room, for exercise, but when I became aware of the fact that it takes exactly 9 steps to walk across it. I stopped. I either have to do 9 steps, or do one extra weird tiny step which feels wrong. So I stopped pacing in my room. I'm currently trying to save up for a walking pad so I can actually pace, but its kinda expensive for me. Especially in birthday season. (All of my families birthday is like a month back to back. And I don't really make my own money. My grandfather gives me $10 a week for house chores, but that's it.)

Idk. I feel like the list of things I can't do are slowly becoming longer and longer. It used to be just meeting new people have me anxiety. Then it became meeting new people. Then it became phone calls. Then it became people that's not my family in general. And then it became coming to new places, specifically reastruants because I was scared of the new environment . And then it became leaving my house. And then it became hygeine and germs. It became to the point where I must take 2 showers a day.  And then it became about sleeping. And now it's about time, and the numbers 0, 5, 15, and 30. (I used to always count to those numbers when I was scared/anxious.) I don't remember when the phobia/anxiety about bugs and parasites hit me. But that is also tacked on.



So yeah. I can't do daily functions. I have this really important test I have to sign up for, but I get severe anxiety everytime I go to do it. Despite the fact that I know they will be nice, and the fact that I've done it before. But it genuinely scares me to get on the phone with people I don't know. I need a job, and I can't do proper job hunting either. Luckily I am only 16, so I can hold this off. But I really don't want to become one of those people who just mooches off of of their family.

My dog shat at the mall and I ended up running away. My mom was grocery shopping and I was basically walking my dog outside the supermarket till he started shitting, which is something he has never done. I was telling my dog to stop but he didn't and ended up leaving a long trail of shit. I was going to clean it up but I didn't have tissues so l called my mom to come but she said she would take more time shopping. So I fucking panicked and ran away. When I got outside there was a lady who passed by me and said ""someone was chasing after you"" and laughed. I kept calling my mom asking if she could come to where it happened cause she has tissues. And she said she would, but she fucking didn't. I was hoping she could come to where I was with tissues and help me clean, but I guess maybe that was a stupid idea. Someone ended up cleaning it after she checked the groceries out and I feel so fucking bad. I couldn't come back inside cause I felt like everyone was laughing at me when it happened. There were so many people passing by and I was dressed up today too. What should I have done instead? I'm seriously so regretful and embarrassed I was just having a panic attack outside. 

I feel like my social anxiety has contributed to me also just running away like that. I don’t know what to do anymore. I don’t think I can ever go to that mall again which sucks but it’s so embarrassing when I think of my response to that situation.

I’ve been told to try at home techniques by shrinks that never help in the slightest. Everytime I go to the doctor they just throw a new pill in my face and none of them work. So far, the only thing that actually works is smoking weed. But it has gotten to the point where I have to be high 24/7 just to not have anxiety. I can always tell when I’m sobering up because the anxiety creeps back in. Sadly, this is not a sustainable way of life. I’ve only been smoking for about 2 years and I can already feel the effect it has on my lungs and I can feel the fog around my brain. Not to stroke my own ego but in school I used to considered a genius. Now I probably couldn’t even pass a GED test. The weed has literally wiped memories completely from my brain. I don’t remember any of my senior year in HS. It makes it harder to retain complex information. I can barely speak a full sentence without stuttering or slurring words. I always tell people I need it to function, and in a sense I do. But in reality i’m just sacrificing mental function for physical function. It’s also not very friendly to my wallet spending $100+ every 4-5 days on a new ounce.

1jk96fr,anxietyhelp,2025-03-26 11:06:31,Im 19 and I’m so done with my life,"
I am 19 years old girl  and I’m fed up with life. At 15, I started treatment for depression and anxiety disorder. Zero support from my family—they treated me like I was abnormal, an attention-seeker, and of course, constantly reminded me how much money was spent on me, etc. I was in treatment for two years, and finally, tired of the guilt-tripping and blame, I stopped it (at almost 18). Let’s say I felt okay—it was definitely much better than before treatment. But in August 2024, the whole cycle started again. It began with tooth pain that I unnecessarily and excessively stressed about. Since then, for the past 8 months, I’ve been feeling different painful ailments every day. None of them last longer than, say, a week, but I get just as worked up and stressed about each one (I know it’s probably hypochondria that I’ve driven myself into). On top of that, I can’t sleep—or rather, I can’t fall asleep—until 3 or 4 in the morning. Every night, I toss and turn in bed, unable to drift off, which means I’m failing school and my internship because I oversleep a lot and don’t wake up to my alarm. My life is falling apart. Every day, I get scolded for sleeping in again. “What’s going to become of me? How will I manage a real job?”—I don’t know either, and that’s why I’m breaking down. I’m not even sure if I’ll pass this school year because of my attendance, and it’s my last one. I made an appointment with a psychiatrist through the National Health Fund (NFZ); my appointment is on May 7th—I’ve been waiting since January. In November, I went to psychotherapy once every two weeks for two months, paying for it out of my student salary (138 EUR, with 92 EUR going to therapy), but I can’t live like this anymore. I don’t know how to help myself when there isn’t a single person around me willing to lend a hand. Everyone thinks I’m lazy or making things up, but I’d give ANYTHING to be able to function normally, and above all, to fall asleep.

1jk04oo,anxietyhelp,2025-03-26 01:21:07,Anxiety following illness??,"I am curious if anyone else has experienced this. My anxiety is usually work related.  I am a procrastinator.  I can talk myself down and through most things. I am not afraid of germs, injury, illness generally.  I dislike the following, but my anxiety is usually a gnawing existential kind of amorphous feeling of general dread.

Then last week happened.  I’m 39 years old, financially comfortable, generally happy and healthy person.  

Last Monday I got home early from work as I was exhausted. I went upstairs to lie down in bed, and fell asleep for seven hours.  When I woke up, I had extreme stomach pains, vomiting, chills diarrhea, sulfur burps, gas, cold sweats.  Full blown norovirus.  I have had food poisoning a handful of times before, and it was the same.  Except last week was not just one night of this.  It went on and on and on, for five grueling nights, and six agonizing days.  I was so weak, I frequently was nearly fainting between my bed and the bathroom (and my bathroom is in my bedroom, so literally five feet).  It was horrible. Since finally recuperating I am feeling extremely anxious.  I feel like afraid to go in my room and very anxious in my room.  Like it was a very traumatic experience being there in the dark, alone in this pain.  And there are things I LOVED to do before this and now, I don’t really care. 

Is this normal to have anxiety and depression brought about after having the stomach flu? Like I get it…being sick for a week sucks.  But I feel like I am being crazy because emotionally I am acting like it was this horrific emotional trauma.  I know for some people who have fears of germs and illness that this would genuinely be that for them.  But that is not me.  I have been sick for weeks at a time with flu or a cold.  I have even had pneumonia.  And I never had this kind of emotional response.

I have a couple thoughts…I had some zolfran which I took as long as I had some.  It was an old prescription and I had about six pills..,so one every eight hours. Apparently zolfran does something with serotonin?? And apparently the things that make your stomach muscles spasm and convulse to vomit or have diarrhea also may have something to do with serotonin?  Could my serotonin levels just be a little out of whack because of that? I genuinely do not know. I am just sad. My bedroom had always been my sanctuary, and now I get anxiety going into it.  And beyond that, I have a nightly routine of doing a manicure that used to fill me with incredible joy and that I looked forward to more than anything.  And now? I just don’t care. :’(

But here’s the part we often forget: *they* are human too. Beneath the red carpets, the Instagram filters, and the glamorous interviews, many celebrities are silently dealing with the same struggles you face. And their stories prove one powerful truth: **anxiety does not define your potential**.

You know her as the queen of heartbreak ballads with a voice that could move mountains. But did you know that **Adele suffers from crippling stage fright**? She once confessed that she’s been so anxious before shows that she has vomited backstage.  

Her solution? She channels her anxiety into raw, emotional performances. The next time you feel your heart pounding with fear, remember this: **even the world’s top performers feel it too—but they show up anyway.**

How does he cope?  
- He uses **humor as a shield**—not to hide his anxiety but to process it.  
- He also swears by **meditation and mindfulness** to calm his racing mind.  

Next time you see someone cracking jokes or wearing a confident mask, remember: **sometimes, laughter is their armor.**

1jfwoev,anxietyhelp,2025-03-20 19:03:35,10 Powerful Tips and Resources to Tackle Anxiety (From Someone Who’s Been There),"If you’re reading this, chances are you’ve battled with anxiety—the kind that makes your heart race over nothing, keeps you awake with irrational thoughts, or makes simple decisions feel paralyzing. I get it. I’ve been there. And I know how lonely and exhausting it can feel.  

But here’s the thing: you *can* regain control. It’s not easy, and it won’t happen overnight, but with the right tools and mindset, you can gradually loosen anxiety’s grip on your life. I’ve put together 10 powerful tips and resources that helped me and thousands of others. Some are simple habits, others are strategies backed by science, and a few are game-changing resources that I wish I’d found sooner.  

### 🧠 **1. Learn to Separate Your Thoughts from Reality**  
Anxiety lies. It makes you believe that your worst-case scenarios are guaranteed. When you feel anxious, pause and ask yourself:  
- *“Is this a fact or a fear?”*  
- *“Has this actually happened or am I predicting it?”*  
Challenging your thoughts creates distance between your mind and reality, weakening anxiety’s hold over you. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) techniques are excellent for this.  

### 🌿 **2. Create a ‘Calm-Down Kit’**  
When anxiety hits, it’s easy to feel powerless. That’s why having a go-to kit can be a lifesaver. Pack a small box or bag with items that ground you:  
✅ Calming scents (lavender oil)  
✅ A stress ball or fidget toy  
✅ A journal to write down your thoughts  
✅ A playlist of soothing songs  
When your mind spirals, reach for your kit—it gives you something tangible to focus on.  

### 💡 **3. Use the 3-3-3 Rule During Panic**  
This is a game-changer when you feel overwhelmed:  
- Name **3 things** you can see.  
- Identify **3 sounds** you can hear.  
- Move **3 parts** of your body (like your ankles, wrists, or fingers).  
This simple grounding technique brings you back into the present, slowing down racing thoughts.  

### 💤 **4. Prioritize Deep Sleep (It’s Anxiety’s Kryptonite)**  
Anxiety and poor sleep fuel each other. Sleep deprivation makes your brain more reactive, heightening anxiety. To improve your sleep:  
- Follow a consistent bedtime routine.  
- Limit screens before bed (blue light disrupts melatonin).  
- Try deep breathing or progressive muscle relaxation before sleeping.  

### 🔥 **5. Control Your Breathing to Control Your Mind**  
Anxiety speeds up your breathing, which can trigger dizziness and more panic. Fight back with controlled breathing:  
- **4-7-8 technique:** Inhale for 4 seconds, hold for 7, exhale for 8. Repeat until you feel calmer.  
- Box breathing (4-4-4-4): Inhale, hold, exhale, and hold for 4 seconds each.   
It takes practice, but slow, deliberate breathing sends calming signals to your brain.  

### 🏃‍♂️ **6. Use Movement as Medicine**  
Exercise is one of the most underrated anxiety remedies. You don’t need to spend hours at the gym—a 20-minute brisk walk is enough to lower cortisol (the stress hormone) and boost mood-enhancing endorphins.  
Bonus tip: Outdoor workouts are twice as effective—nature itself is a natural anxiety-reliever.  

### 🔗 **7. Anchor Yourself with Sensory Tricks**  
When anxiety pulls you into your head, use your senses to ground yourself:  
- **Taste:** Suck on a sour candy or chew gum to engage your taste buds.  
- **Touch:** Hold ice cubes or run cold water over your hands—temperature shock refocuses your brain.  
- **Smell:** Carry a small vial of essential oil and take slow, deep inhales.  
These sensory shifts help snap you out of overthinking mode.  

### 💬 **8. Stop Fighting Anxiety—Observe It**  
Here’s the paradox: the more you fight anxiety, the stronger it gets. Instead of battling it, practice observing it. When you feel anxious, label the experience:  
- *“I feel anxious right now, and that’s okay.”*  
- *“This is just my mind reacting, not reality.”*  
Mindful observation takes the emotional sting out of anxiety.  

### 🌿 **9. Use Natural Supplements and Calming Teas**  
While medication helps some people, natural remedies can be incredibly effective for mild to moderate anxiety:  
- **Magnesium:** Reduces nervous system excitability.  
- **L-theanine:** Found in green tea, it promotes relaxation without drowsiness.  
- **Chamomile tea:** A natural sedative that calms frazzled nerves.  
Always check with your doctor before adding supplements.  

### 🔥 **10. Leverage Proven Anxiety Resources**  
There are powerful, science-backed resources specifically designed to help people overcome anxiety. One that genuinely made a difference for me is [The Anti-Anxiety Formula](https://www.anxietysupports.com/p/the-anti-anxiety-formula/676c36b8f5a09abff8e98e6b). It offers practical tools, expert guidance, and strategies that actually work. If you’re looking for a step-by-step roadmap to conquer anxiety, I highly recommend checking it out.

1jficv3,anxietyhelp,2025-03-20 06:06:31,Fear of suicidal thoughts,"This is a very strange thing to put into words and I apologize in advance because english isn’t my first language. 27F here, I’ve been on and off from prozac for the past 4-5 years (right now I’m off of it). I have been feeling down this past month and I plan to discuss it with my therapist on our next session along with what I’m about to say. 

I had a very strange feeling today that scared me so much, I want to explain that even during the worst peak of my anxiety and depression I have never experienced suicidal thoughts. But today as I was experiencing sadness I suddenly thought “what if I ever get sad enough to be suicidal?” and that scared the shit out of me. I do not want to take my life, I have never planned it or thought of how I’d do it or anything in that matter, but now that feeling is lingering on my mind.

Has anyone else experienced this? Like not actual suicidal thoughts but just the fear of ever actually having them? Hope I explained myself well, sorry if this is too long and messy.

1jf8waz,anxietyhelp,2025-03-19 21:51:59,How do you get rid of that pit in your stomach?,"It's just so nonstop. It's physical, deep in my belly. Like a gut punched that turned solid midway and stays there. Like the panicked fear you get moments before you wreck you car, but even that goes away once the wrecking is finished. Nothing I do stops it; be it meds, gym, jacuzzi, walking, driving, therapy, support groups,a toke, beer, cigarettes, avoiding any of those vices, nature, the hobbies I can't will myself to do, work that I barely manage, YouTube as a distraction. My mind then follows (or leads?) and does nothing but replay every negative scenarios and intrusive thoughts in the worst light imaginable all while telling me what a vile human being i must be.I'm even considering TMS (wireless shock therapy for £6000! Amazing!). It's been months non stop like this. It's not livable. I've reached out to all my doctors at this stage. Even gut related ones. It just won't go away and actually seems to be getting worse. ED will laugh me off. Nor can I afford to be put in a mental ward. I'm at a loss for where else to turn to for help, as I don't have any friends that can deal with me like this. Beyond my aging mother, I have 1 family member left and even they said they don't want the drama. I just want to be able to function without this physical pain in me. I feel inherently broken.

1jf4tfq,anxietyhelp,2025-03-19 19:02:53,Overcoming Depression: The Steps That Saved Me (And Can Save You Too),"**Depression feels like you’re drowning in slow motion.** You’re gasping for air while the world continues to spin as if nothing is wrong. You may wake up feeling exhausted despite sleeping for hours. You may fake a smile, convinced no one notices the heavy weight crushing your chest. And worst of all, you might feel utterly alone—trapped in your own mind.  

But you’re not alone. And you *can* overcome this. 

I’ve been there. I know what it’s like to feel hopeless, but I also know that healing is possible. It’s not easy. It’s not quick. But it’s possible. Here’s what helped me—and what I hope can help you too.  

---

### 🔥 **1. You Don’t Have to Fight Alone**

I used to think that depression was a battle I had to win on my own. I was wrong.  

There’s a voice in your head that might say, *“You’re a burden,”* or *“No one cares.”* That voice is lying. When I finally opened up to a close friend about how I was feeling, I was shocked by their kindness. I realized that people wanted to help—they just didn’t know I was struggling.  

💡 **Action Step:**  
- Text or call *one person* today. You don’t have to say, “I’m depressed.” You can just say, “Hey, I’m having a rough time. Can we talk?”  
- If you have no one you feel comfortable reaching out to, consider anonymous online support groups. They can be a lifeline.  

---

### 🛑 **2. Safety First: Create a Plan for Dark Days**

Depression has a cruel way of making you forget that things can get better. On your darker days, you may feel convinced that hope is a distant memory.  

That’s why **having a plan when you’re in a clearer headspace is essential**.  
- **Make a list** of people you can call when you’re in crisis.  
- Keep **emergency helpline numbers** saved in your phone.  
- Write down **reasons to hold on**—your pet, your sibling, your favorite song, or even the memory of a moment that made you feel alive.  

💡 **Action Step:**  
- Right now, take 5 minutes to create a small “safety net” list on your phone’s notes app. It could save your life.  

---

### 🌿 **3. The Small Things Are the Big Things**

When depression has its grip on you, even basic self-care feels impossible. I remember days when brushing my teeth or getting out of bed felt like monumental tasks.  

**But here’s the thing:** Doing *anything* is a win. If all you did today was shower, **that’s a victory**. If you managed to eat something, **that’s progress**. Healing starts with small, consistent steps.  

💡 **Action Step:**  
- Make a “bare minimum” self-care list.  
- On tough days, aim for 1–2 small wins. Example:  
    - Brush your teeth.  
    - Open a window for fresh air.  
    - Drink a glass of water.  

These micro-actions create momentum. They’re not meaningless—they’re *everything*.  

---

### 🌤️ **4. Fight for Your Routine (Even When It Feels Pointless)**

Depression thrives in chaos. It feeds on disconnection. The less structure you have, the more room it takes.  

When I was struggling, **creating a simple routine saved me**. I didn’t make it complicated—I just started with:  
- Waking up at the same time every day.  
- Walking for 10 minutes.  
- Eating at regular intervals, even when I wasn’t hungry.  

Routine brings back stability. It sends a message to your brain that says: *“I’m still here. I’m still showing up.”*  

💡 **Action Step:**  
- Choose one thing you can do daily, no matter what. It could be as simple as making your bed or listening to one song you love.  

---

### 🌱 **5. Don’t Underestimate Professional Help**

I know it’s not easy. Asking for help feels vulnerable. I used to think therapy was for people who were “really” struggling—not people like me, who could still function. But I was wrong.  

**You don’t have to be at rock bottom to deserve help.**  
- Therapy offers a safe space to unpack the heavy thoughts weighing you down.  
- Medication (if needed) is not a sign of weakness—it’s a tool to help you heal.  

If you’ve been considering getting help, this is your sign. **You deserve support.**  

💡 **Action Step:**  
- If you’ve been hesitant, consider booking a consultation with a mental health professional. Many offer free or low-cost initial sessions.  

---

### 💡 **Final Thought: You Are Worth Saving**

I won’t lie to you—**healing from depression is a fight**. But it’s a fight you *can* win. One breath at a time. One day at a time.  

There were days I didn’t think I would make it. But I did. And so will you.  
You don’t have to rush. You don’t have to be perfect. You just have to keep going.

1jeps6k,anxietyhelp,2025-03-19 05:19:12,What is your experience with panic attacks and what are your symptoms? How did you figure out that it wasn’t something life-threatening?," TW: death, medical trauma and substance trauma

(21F) I apologize about how long this is going to be. I personally feel that to learn about something, I need to know the whole picture. I’m sure there are some of you with similar stories or experiences. And I’m sure there will be questions lol.

current medical conditions: PSVT, severe panic disorder, GAD, chronic depression, PTSD, ADHD-primarily inattentive, severe impulsivity, delayed sleep phase disorder, abnormal REM sleep, eosinophilic esophagitis, severe GERD

I was diagnosed with GAD, depression and PTSD when I was 12, which I developed due to my dad going into respiratory arrest when I was 9. He survived but it scarred me forever and have been dealing with it ever since. Had many issues in school, never went, was always depressed and anxious and barely graduated (COVID saved my ass though). Literally missed 100 days of my freshman year due to depression and anxiety and my sleep disorders.

Fast forward to 18, my dad ended up passing away in 2022 from multi organ failure following a heart attack (was suspected v-fib and/or STEMI, but he also had congestive heart failure, both types of diabetes, severe asthma, and a bunch of other conditions). I had a very bad reaction to synthetic THC about a year later that put me in the hospital, where I had to get my heart stopped twice. I have suspected my panic attacks are a combination of PSVT (have been diagnosed), somatic symptom disorder, and cardiophobia (which I developed after my dad died). 

I never really got panic attacks before my dad died, but after that and my reaction to synthetic THC, it has been HORRIBLE. At the beginning I used to get panic attacks mainly during the day, during school, work, while driving, with friends, etc.. but as it has progressed, I’ve started to have them mainly in my sleep and after I eat. I’ve been to the hospital a total of 17 times since 2022, 4 ambulances, with at-least 13 of those being just for panic attacks. 

I’ve literally had dreams about having strokes. At one point I basically had a pulse-ox glued to my finger 24/7 because I didn’t like that my heart rate jumped so high when I stood up. I thought I had POTS for a week and convinced myself I was going to be bedridden forever after I almost passed out once time when standing up. I actually called 911 one time for a panic attack after my HR jumped to 190 when walking up the stairs, and the paramedic noticed I had a pulse-ox on, to which he ripped it off my finger and threw it across the room and it broke. He told me to stop using it because constantly checking it was only going to make my anxiety worse. His reaction may have been a little overkill but I realized how much it was contributing once I stopped using it. Huge thanks to that paramedic, whoever you are.

These are some of the symptoms I will wake up with, or what I usually have when a panic attack comes on:

*racing heart (not sure if due to my PSVT)
*trouble breathing
*weird feeling in my body, maybe impending doom
*hot flashes
*dizziness
*one side of head gets cold or hot (alternates)
*blood pools in fingers/feels very hot
*tingling in whole body, one side of head, one side of body, usually changes each time
*feel like passing out, most of the time never do
*chest pain (only sometimes)
*sometimes get delirious
*blood pressure probably rises (I can feel it)
*always feel like I’m dying
*sometimes my adrenaline is so overactive that my body feels like it’s convulsing. I’ve had it happen multiple times in an ambulance but also at home as well

I usually wake up with a few of these symptoms, always with heart racing but the other symptoms always change. I can’t take naps without waking up feeling like this. Sometimes I wake up in the middle of the night and experience these (whether I had a nightmare or not). I also will have some of these after I eat, which may be due to just eating large meals but I’ve also wondered if feeling it every single time is normal. 

Usually to calm myself down, I have to be around someone and talk to them/have them talk to me, watch youtube or something to occupy my brain, have them hold my hand really tight and try to distract me while my symptoms start to subside and the adrenaline kicks in. I usually am violently shaking towards the end of the panic attack, which used to scare me, but I have now learned that for me, that is a signal it is going to stop soon. I just wait for it to go away. Worst case scenario, I will take a hydroxyzine, which helps so much but it just makes me exhausted the next day.

My mom has also told me that everytime I have a panic attack, I’m always telling her “this one feels different” and trying to convince her she needs to call 911. I am aware that I am doing it but it feels justified during the panic attack because I am worried something is genuinely wrong. I’ve always been worried to ignore what is going on, incase it is something life threatening and then I die because of it.

I have also had the following tests done (because of my panic attacks):

*cardiac echo (no structural abnormalities)
*multiple MRIs on head (no tissue or nerve abnormalities) 
*EEG for brain (no electrical abnormalities)
*CT angiogram (after synthetic THC reaction to rule out blood clot), CT abdominal and CT brain (this one was after a car accident but I was still experiencing severe panic, ended up having a concussion)
*worn multiple holter monitors (Zio patch helped me get diagnosed with PSVT)
*EKGs (always sinus tach)
*CMP, BMP, thyroid, adrenal glands bloodwork (all came back fine multiple times)
*troponin and d-dimer multiple times at hospital (d-dimer was elevated different times but suspected due to just trauma and not blood clot. there could be a number of reasons)
*many chest x-rays (all fine except one time when I had pleurisy from a sickness, but it went away)
*3 sleep studies (just had one recently to see if they could catch my panic attacks while sleeping)

So basically I’ve seen sleep medicine, neurology, cardiology, general PCP and psychiatry for everything related to my panic attacks. I was going to see rheumatology at one point but I don’t remember why I didn’t (probably missed the appointment or something).

So far, the only diagnoses that have come out of this (post-2022, my dad dying and the reaction to synthetic THC) have been panic disorder and PSVT (which took 2 years to get diagnosed due to drs shrugging it off). I have heard of somatic symptom disorder as well but never been officially diagnosed. I also recently learned of Roemheld’s syndrome, which is basically when cardiac symptoms are triggered after GI disturbances, but it’s not a condition and more a group of symptoms. Although it’s fairly unrecognized and most of the time gets passed off as anxiety. Thinking about bringing it up to my GI doc soon since I will need to get another scope for my Eosinophilic Esophagitis (could also be contributing to my anxiety, been diagnosed since I was 15). 

The cardiophobia, which I didn’t realize even had a name, mostly explains what I am usually worried about when having a panic attack. Especially when they come out of nowhere and I haven’t experienced a conscious trigger. Although it may be subconscious as well. I read somewhere that if you’ve had a loved one die, you’re more likely to develop panic attacks that have symptoms similar to what they died from. So in my case, a lot of my symptoms feel cardiac related, even though electrically (besides the PSVT) and structurally everything is fine. 

I’ve had people try to tell me I’m a hypochondriac and that I’m just chasing the labels, but that doesn’t really make sense when they can actively and visually see something is going on with me. That being said, I do see myself being hypersensitive to any weird bodily sensations and automatically thinking the worst. And it doesn’t help that I constantly sleep like shit due to my sleeping disorders, which probably is just making it worse.

For context, I am currently on 100mg of Zoloft 1x day and 25mg Hydroxyzine as needed for panic attacks. I do not take any heart meds for my PSVT because my cardiologist did not recommend it unless my symptoms are so severe that I can’t function. Thankfully PSVT is not super dangerous like A-fib and he said it usually goes away as you age. He does suspect it is triggered by my panic attacks though. I linked my experience with Zoloft below that I explained to someone else:

https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/s/JagynpjV2d

I have gotten to the point where I am able to function and control my panic attacks most of the time, but when they happen, it still freaks me out just as bad as it has every other time. I guess that’s just part of living with the disorder. I have high heart rate notifications turned off on my apple watch, don’t use a pulse ox anymore, have been drinking more water. Once I get my ADHD and time management under control, I plan to start exercising and eating better (easier said than done though). I also recently started CBT which I know can help treat a lot of the conditions I struggle with, so I’m hoping it will help me manage those more efficiently too. Especially since I want to go to medical school and specialize in neurology… lmao. I guess it shows. Definitely need to get this under control.

Just wanted to share my story and was curious if anyone has had similar experiences and what your story is. I have found it helps me to hear other perspectives and ways that people have gone through these types of things. 

TL:DR panic attacks when eating and sleeping, taking zoloft and hydroxyzine when needed. have had many medical tests done and everything has come back mostly fine. have some medical conditions that

1jemxou,anxietyhelp,2025-03-19 02:30:59,Trauma from childhood predator started stalking me,I don't ever write on here but I don't have anyone to talk to and I was hoping to write out my concerns to help get some of this weight off of me. When I was 13 a close friend of mine (same age) had a step brother who has a close friend we will call a Thomas (19 years old). Thomas showed interest in me and being 13 back in the late 90s I thought it was because I was special. Typical grooming behavior from him. We should started making out every chance we could. We eventually tried having sex but because I was so young it was very painful and at first he didn't listen when I said stop and eventually he finally did. This whole fling lasted a couple years until I was 15 and he was 21. I left all of that behind me and thought because it was my choice then he didn't do anything wrong. As I got older I realized how disgusting he was and found out he had done this with many other girls 5 to 6 years underage. Fast forward to 2022 which had been over 20 years since I last spoke to him. I get a random text saying hey this is Thomas and asked for me by name. I immediately started shaking and first response was how did you get my information. Which he told me he got a private investigator because he is in a branch of the military and knew someone. I cussed him out told him to never contact me again and blocked him. A year later with a different number the same thing happens. I've always suffered randomly from panic attacks but they have been non stop since then. And I don't know why this has shaken me up so badly. I have kids and my husband knows the situation the moment I got the first text. My insurance doesn't cover any decent therapy or psychologists in my area and I've been trying to deal with it on my own but I feel scared he knows where I live and we weren't ever in love or anything so I'm so confused why he's doing this. I just needed a safe place to vent annonymosly and if I left out anything and anyone has questions feel free to ask.

I have a case of 'job anxiety' and was hoping that someone might be able to help in any sort of way. 

I recently started a job in a big city which is something I have always wanted to do.  I've done the whole moving process and am now 4 months into the new job. However, I am very stressed that I am going to lose my job or that I am not working hard enough. I have not been told that I'm doing a bad job. I've gotten a bit chewed out for minor mistakes but nothing major. 

I just have this sense of impending doom and what makes it all the more stressful is that I'm alone in a new city with people/pets/rent all depending on me.

1je4rku,anxietyhelp,2025-03-18 13:19:55,What do you do when you feel an anxiety breakdown/episode oncoming?,"I don't experience my anxiety as very specific isolated moments like ""panic attacks"". Instead when something triggers me I usually experience what I'd call an ""episode"" that goes this way: 1) I experience exhaustion and mental spirals after a triggering event, 2) I wake up early the next day feeling my heart racing and nausea starting to set in, struggle to get back to sleep, 3) I jolt awake early the third day to a full blown morning panic attack + painful fight or flight. I'm talking racing horrible thoughts (the worst part), heart palpitations, difficulty sleeping, difficulty keeping anything down - and it leaves me quite literally bedridden for days on end. 

I'm puzzled what to do when I feel this ""wave"" of anxiety incoming, because I feel kind of helpless in the face of it. I try to do the DARE/RIDE method, I eat pretty well, I reach out to my support groups + friends. I'm on an SSRI that used to work to fully prevent this exact type of ""bedridden"" effect, but recently I experienced one of these episodes for the first time while on my meds (very frightening experience), and now my psychiatrist is trying me on an anti-convulsant as well.

I’ve been dealing with chronic anxiety for past few months. It seems that when even I get better, there seems to be a new medical issue for me. I was having problems with my stomach. Acid reflux, heart burn, etc. I was tested for low D and have been taking it for the last 6 weeks. 50000 IU. Tested negative for H-Pylori. Started eating healthy and taking omeprazole and slowly felt better. But now I have an issue with my wisdom tooth and now I need to have my wisdom teeth removed. My stomach isn’t it best shape, and I’m afraid that I will really struggle to eat when I get my wisdom teeth extracted. I have both the extraction and the gastro doc appointment soon and I feel pretty much overwhelmed. I was dam near having a panic attack at the dentist. 

I’ve been reluctant to take the anxiety medication I was prescribed (Escitalopram) but I been left with no choice but to take it. I had a terrible reaction. I had nausea for a few hours. I don’t plan on stopping. 

 I sometimes feel hopeless that I’ve been trying to get better and then there’s something that happens and I get spooked. My sleep has not been great. Im nervous what I need to do. 

If you have any advice how I can manage this feel free to reply.

1j7a15c,mentalhealthsupport,2025-03-09 15:30:41,I feel disgusting because of something I did as a minor.,"Hello, I am currently 21. Sorry I didn't put that in the title.

Throwaway account because I feel terrible about this.

I also posted this on r/TrueOffMyChest. Posting it here because I need some help (or at least words of advice) if anyone can offer.

When I was young (10 maybe) and I got an Ipod. I would love doing stuff on it. But then I got into fanfiction and thus I got into porn (I still love fanfiction to this day). I also was able to gain access to porn sites (Pornhub, Xvideoes, Spankbang, etc). My mom had to work long hours and my uncle mostly left me alone (we're both quiet), it got more convinent when I got old enough to become a lackey kid (14)

But that day, I was in the mood for porn every chapter (what I now know as PWP)

So I would type chapter 'large number' and then put tits or ass and then search. I was already seeing gross things I wasn't supposed to but then I found a website and it had adults engaging with minors.

I was aware that sort of thing was bad, but this was written not visual. I knew the visual stuff was terrible and never looked for that sort of thing. But the written stuff?

I just kept reading it, I justified it as it's only weird if I'm an adult. I never visualized ACTUAL real life children, I would think about other fictional characters, not sure if that's better but I did.

But now I'm an adult and I feel disgusting! I NEVER want to hurt a child in that way! I despise child molestors! And yet I still read this stuff. I stopped when I was about 18-19 (not sure spefically but I know I haven't read that stuff in the past three years and I remember not being able to find the sites anymore, which was good in the long run)

Lately, I've been feeling really gross. Like I'm disgusting and I should feel awful what I did! Which I should! It's gotten worse this past year, I didn't really think about it. I still read stuff where characters were underage but limited to just being in their teens (someone on AO3 who does a bunch of Harry Potter/crossover girls stuff and another one who had his own website and was registered on Literotica). I want to cut those people out of my reading too! I feel horrible for what I've done and read.

More context: I live with my mother (she knows about the video porn thing, but not the written stuff), I'm a college student, I can't drive (I rideshare everywhere). I WANT to get therapy but I don't want to spend money. My mom has actually taken me to therapy a few times (this problem hadn't affected me mentally yet for me to bring it up, plus most of the time my mother was in room, so I wouldn't have done so regardless), I actually got diagnosed with anxiety. But I assume the reason we don't make it a regular thing is because it's expensive. The best thing I feel I can do is go to hotlines.

Sometimes they do make me feel better. Once I watched some YT video about someone who hurt animals and I thought I could handle it, but the woman said this man also read stuff from one of the sites I found (I never liked that, I would avoid that if I saw it) and I FELT DESPECIBLE! The hotline got me a nice lady that told me some gentle things that made me calm down.

But then I read one of the guy's I mentioned work on Literotica, the characters were ACTUALLY OF LEGAL AGE and it felt like I relapsed! Then I watched porn on a specific website for specific kink of me, but when I was looking for something one of the videoes said 'teenage' and I began to spiral. Because of one hand, not all pornsites are trustworthy but on the other, 18 and 19 (legal adult age) could still be referred to as teenage so I was confused, so I called them and the lady didn't want to help me and she transferred me to a warmline (they were nice but they asked for my insurance which I wasn't expecting so I ended up feeling emotionally drained).

It came to a head when I woke up this morning and I was on my period and then I started feeling those thoughts that was disgusting while my body was in pain. I couldn't call because my mother was still asleep. So I texted my hotline and the woman said my problem wasn't something a hotline could fix, so she sent me all these links to porn addiction stuff. They either cost money or I felt they couldn't help me, because they talked about this happening to men. Alternatively, they could help but my mother was still in the house, so I still felt I couldn't do anything immediately. And it really felt like no one could help me. I even signed up for Betterhelp (though I remembered they had controversy and signed out before telling my problem). So I decided to post this on here.

I really don't want to hurt anyone. I want to put that terrible part of my past behind me. But sometimes I can't help but think about it and feel disgusting.",12,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/MentalHealthSupport/comments/1j7a15c/i_feel_disgusting_because_of_something_i_did_as_a/,feel disgusting something minor Hello currently 21 Sorry didnt put title Throwaway account feel terrible also posted rTrueOffMyChest Posting need help least words advice anyone offer young 10 maybe got Ipod would love stuff got fanfiction thus got porn still love fanfiction day also able gain access porn sites Pornhub Xvideoes Spankbang etc mom work long hours uncle mostly left alone quiet got convinent got old enough become lackey kid 14 day mood porn every chapter know PWP would type chapter large number put tits ass search already seeing gross things wasnt supposed found website adults engaging minors aware sort thing bad written visual knew visual stuff terrible never looked sort thing written stuff kept reading justified weird Im adult never visualized ACTUAL real life children would think fictional characters sure thats better Im adult feel disgusting NEVER want hurt child way despise child molestors yet still read stuff stopped 1819 sure spefically know havent read stuff past three years remember able find sites anymore good long run Lately Ive feeling really gross Like Im disgusting feel awful gotten worse past year didnt really think still read stuff characters underage limited teens someone AO3 bunch Harry Pottercrossover girls stuff another one website registered Literotica want cut people reading feel horrible Ive done read context live mother knows video porn thing written stuff Im college student cant drive rideshare everywhere WANT get therapy dont want spend money mom actually taken therapy times problem hadnt affected mentally yet bring plus time mother room wouldnt done regardless actually got diagnosed anxiety assume reason dont make regular thing expensive best thing feel go hotlines Sometimes make feel better watched YT video someone hurt animals thought could handle woman said man also read stuff one sites found never liked would avoid saw FELT DESPECIBLE hotline got nice lady told gentle things made calm read one guys mentioned work Literotica characters ACTUALLY LEGAL AGE felt like relapsed watched porn specific website specific kink looking something one videoes said teenage began spiral one hand pornsites trustworthy 18 19 legal adult age could still referred teenage confused called lady didnt want help transferred warmline nice asked insurance wasnt expecting ended feeling emotionally drained came head woke morning period started feeling thoughts disgusting body pain couldnt call mother still asleep texted hotline woman said problem wasnt something hotline could fix sent links porn addiction stuff either cost money felt couldnt help talked happening men Alternatively could help mother still house still felt couldnt anything immediately really felt like one could help even signed Betterhelp though remembered controversy signed telling problem decided post really dont want hurt anyone want put terrible part past behind sometimes cant help think feel disgusting
1j3veuk,mentalhealthsupport,2025-03-05 04:57:51,"19, Depressed and struggling with finding motivation and disappointing parents.","I am a nineteen year old male and have been living with depression and anxiety since I was 14. For the past year and so since graduating I have been struggling immensely with motivating myself to do anything. I am currently in therapy one day every two weeks, I find it helps, yet I have suicidal thoughts every day. 

My parents pressure me to find a job often, and rightfully so, I only work one day a week  and I would like to find a part-time job, but I find it so incredibly difficult to make myself do anything. I also worry things will get worse if I feel even somewhat as mentally exhausted as I do after one day of work. I currently won’t even do or try to accomplish things I enjoy anymore. I’ve expressed my desire to achieve something with my life but also my feeling that my life is hopeless and fated to end with suicide or failure. I feel as though I’m just laying idle because I’m afraid of death and want to be as close to it as I can without actually committing suicide.

I want to die but to also succeed and my parents get frustrated with that contradiction and say I don’t actually want to die, which could be true but I’ve thought and planned out death before.

I would also like to go to University for English Literature, but every time I start the application process I get overwhelmed, anxious and nihilistic at attempting to figure out the process. We are currently attempting to look for an ADHD diagnosis since we’ve expected I’ve had it since I was young. I also  messed up a lot in High School and now have to upgrade a course for university and it’s gotten much more stressful and overwhelming to me for that. Not to mention even more damaging to my already weak self-image.

I feel so incredibly overwhelmed by life right now and like I’m a complete failure for my lack of a proper job, a pursuit in my interests, or going to university.
I feel like life is not capable of getting better and it’s my fault for not motivating myself to do anything. Suicide is prominent on my mind and it frightens me that it feels like the easiest option for me. I guess I just feel like a complete mess up and I’m desperately searching for any sign that things can get better.",13,12,https://www.reddit.com/r/MentalHealthSupport/comments/1j3veuk/19_depressed_and_struggling_with_finding/,19 Depressed struggling finding motivation disappointing parents nineteen year old male living depression anxiety since 14 past year since graduating struggling immensely motivating anything currently therapy one day every two weeks find helps yet suicidal thoughts every day parents pressure find job often rightfully work one day week would like find parttime job find incredibly difficult make anything also worry things get worse feel even somewhat mentally exhausted one day work currently wont even try accomplish things enjoy anymore Ive expressed desire achieve something life also feeling life hopeless fated end suicide failure feel though Im laying idle Im afraid death want close without actually committing suicide want die also succeed parents get frustrated contradiction say dont actually want die could true Ive thought planned death would also like go University English Literature every time start application process get overwhelmed anxious nihilistic attempting figure process currently attempting look ADHD diagnosis since weve expected Ive since young also messed lot High School upgrade course university gotten much stressful overwhelming mention even damaging already weak selfimage feel incredibly overwhelmed life right like Im complete failure lack proper job pursuit interests going university feel like life capable getting better fault motivating anything Suicide prominent mind frightens feels like easiest option guess feel like complete mess Im desperately searching sign things get better
1jca5se,mentalhealthsupport,2025-03-16 01:12:24,Only one person came to my birthday celebration tonight and I feel so bitterly depressed and lonely. How do I go forward?,"Tonight was my birthday celebration and only one person showed up. We did our best to have a good time but it felt awkward and I wish I hadn't bothered.

I'm both depressed and extremely angry about this, even though most people dropped out for legit reasons but a few others were flakes who I think could have communicated better with me. I'm not actually angry at anyone in particular as nobody owes me their time but I am absolutely fed up to absolute death of not feeling like a priority in anyone's life. I attended multiple friend's 30ths recently where dozens of people showed up for a big dance hall party and I have to deal with basically nobody in my life celebrating me? I've brought this feeling up on Reddit before and some replies amounted to 'why are you as a grown man upset nobody came to your birthday? What are you, a child?' which doesn't help this feeling and frankly is a c**ty thing to say.

It's on me to improve this for myself, as I am admittedly absolutely terrible at making meaningful connections with people out of fear and growing up with worthless role models. But I cannot keep living like this, I am so fucking lonely and change feels impossible. I will no doubt get loads of messages and questions asking how it went and I don't know how to react honestly without looking like a bitter asshole or a giant loser. I don't know how to change my life and be honest in making better connections and relationships with people because I don't know how to value myself in these moments.

I suffer really bad with nostalgia depression. If you’re reading this you probably know what it is but for those who don’t… usually nostalgia is something nice and warm and “a trip down memory lane” but when I get it I feel awful, sad, useless, desperate to relive those days knowing that they are gone, and I feel this way from a few hours to sometimes a couple of days. It comes and goes in terms of how devastating it is but it’s always there sort of. When I hang out with my best mate, I spent so much time talking about our old college parties and feel terrible about it and sometimes (and this is the worst) I’ll create a group chat with all of our group from school / college and get ready to send them all a message). My life isn’t exactly bad now, in facts it’s pretty decent but I just feel awful about it. Im only 26 but I notice now that it starts effecting “in the now” moments; like I’ll be enjoying myself and think “I really need to enjoy this because I’ll look back at this moment in the future”. It’s hard to describe exactly. I guess I wanted to know how others deal with it? I don’t do therapy or anything like that and I’ve never been on medication for anything. Is there any good books or anything? What would you recommend because it’s really taking over me lately.

Today I got told by my school mentor that the other teachers say that I have a ‘negative vibe’ when I’m in the classroom. I don’t know what it means, but I can’t see myself in it, so it hurted me a lot when I heard it. How can I change something that I’m not aware of.

1javjj9,mentalhealthsupport,2025-03-14 04:13:47,"I feel like I should be happy, but I’m not","I’m a 22M, in my last year of college. I don’t think I have a single reason to keep living other than “my mom will be sad”. My last relationship was 3 years ago, and I don’t think my friends would care too much if I just disappeared - we’re not that close anyway.

I’m not happy at all. Maybe it’s because I’m job hunting right now (in software industry, so a bit tough right now). I have never enjoyed my major - I got into it for the money, and the money is pretty good to be fair. I’ve felt pretty anxious every time I job searched, but this time is the worst by far. I didn’t get the return offer from an internship I worked my ass off in, and my current internship just had layoffs and a hiring freeze. I’m an anxious person, and I feel like that doubled my anxiety. And my worry is that I would keep feeling like this even after I find a job.

I’ve always had a problem with comparing myself with others. It feels like everyone is ahead of me. I tried so hard, but every night I’m thinking “why is nothing working out for me?”. I see all my friends with great jobs, and everyone on LinkedIn getting positions that I would love to have. I also see a lot of people my age born into retirement money or getting lucky / grinding something for a few years to become rich and retire. I know everyone wants this, but I don’t even want to work, I just want to retire. The thought of working another 40 years for no reason dreads me. I even thought of gambling my savings and just dying if it didn’t work out. I’ve tried so hard, even paid for therapy out of my own pocket to stop myself from comparing myself to others but I can’t seem to get rid of this trait of mine.

But I feel like I should be happy. I have a loving family. I grew up in a decently wealthy family and I have a pretty good amount saved up from my internships, probably top 5% in my age group. There are so many people that have it much worse than me, and I feel like there is no reason for me to feel this sad. But I do.

I’m breaking down several times per day crying. Everytime I see my family I want to cry, and I avoid them everytime I get teary eyed. I don’t want my family to worry because of me. Once my mom told me not to stress too much and that everything will be okay, and I almost broke down crying on the spot. I can’t fall asleep without edibles. I think I had my first anxiety attack today, and I’m losing my ability to focus every day. I’m going to bomb my few interviews that I managed to get at this rate, and I know I’d feel even worse if that happened. I know what I have to do. Just lock in for a few months to grind out for a job, but I just can’t seem to do it.

I know there are issues with my personality. I have trouble making friends anywhere and always feel like an outsider. I think I’m on the autism spectrum, and maybe slightly sociopathic as well. I hate the anxious and depressed trait of mine. I think all this is inherited from my parents - my dad suffers from the same anxiety (i think), and both my parents are slightly sociopathic and always outsiders. I don’t want kids simply because I’m worried my child will have to go through the same life that I am living right now.

Why am I so unhappy? When will I find happiness? Why should I keep living? What is my purpose?

1jkretx,mentalhealthsupport,2025-03-27 00:33:57,Has anyone ever taken years off work to tend to their mental health? How did you support yourself ?,"Hi , I’m a black 26 YO woman. 

Years of trauma , young adolescent homelessness , worked myself through college and dx with MDD & anxiety at some point , then Bipolar, and now PDD x Borderline . 

I never really got a break in life to care for my mental health properly. Was always in survival mode but did what I could building a tool kit to keep my mental above water just enough to get through the next crisis. 

Life started to calm and get a little more stable (housing &started work) but even with going to therapy twice a week for 2 hours each session I still struggled tremendously. Eventually my therapist talked me into going inpatient, taking leave from work and now I’m doing intensive outpatient M-F 4 hours per day which is a lot of emotional labor but has been helpful enough to get me out of this spiraling despair I was in. 

I’m due to go back to work in May but I don’t think I’ll be ready even with accommodations at work and concurrent intensive treatment. I think I need to work on my mental health and address my trauma without worrying about work. I can’t do both. And I think I’ll need way more than just a few weeks. Maybe years 

The issue is: 

I support myself . There’s no family or friends to fall back on financially (not even emotionally really either).

Has anyone ever taken years long break from work to tend to their mental health? What resources might be available to me for finances , housing , meals? I know about the basic government stuff . disability , SNAP, etc . But looking for your not basic answers here. I’m at a loss.

I'm a 15 yr old girl who's currently struggling with alot of problems. Funny how i can't even express myself this honestly to my psychiatrist than here posting online to strangers in attempt to feel heard.

Right now im typing this as i sit in my bed in the middle of my messy room, my mind conflicted after just crying and thinking about how i'll be able to get better. I have school tomorrow and i have no motivation to go whatsoever, i just dont seem to care anymore whether what will happen to me in the future but what i know is i dont wanna keep being a burden and a disappointment to my whole family. I've been bullied most of my life which was the start of how things started spiraling down, and also one of the main reasons as to why i have grown a immense fear of interacting with people and even making simple eye contact. I've been a straight A student ever since my elementary days which is a stark difference to who i am now. My grades are barely existent due to frequent and continued absences.. which had been going on for the past few years ever since high school started. Everyone practically gave up on me and im known in the classroom as the ''depressed kid'' which everyone avoids since who would want to be with a person like that? all my teachers could care less if i go or not, they'll just eventually drop me anyway. I have barely any friends since i pushed them away and the deep rooted insecurities i have makes it all worse paired with my depression. And what could even go worse? I asked myself before just recently having my father pass away a week ago due to a heart attack right infront of my eyes before i ran to my room and locked the door, shaking while covering my ears to not have to listen to his desperate sounds of trying to stay alive while the paramedics arrived and carried him towards the ambulance to drive him over the hospital. After just a few hours, he was eventually announced deceased and i just sat there, holding the phone in one hand while my mother sobbed on the other side of the line. Ever since that day, i just can't get proper sleep and get the vivid images out of my head.. i feel so hopeless and i dont know what to do.

This just happened and I can't tell if I am right feeling upset. My mas friend was over all day and I assumed he was going to be leaving at night. I don't leave my room while people are at my house due to extreme anxiety. So I took a nap and then woke up and got told that her friend, along with another person is staying the night. I don't do well with things that I am already nervous about and change of plans. I want to be respectful to her so I tough out my panic attack and breakdown in my room. Or that was the plan. Straight freaking out for a hour, my rational thinking is out the window. I hear her tell the guests that ""she just has problems"". I was trying so hard to calm down, I ended up hitting myself and giving myself bruises on my face, falling into habits of pain making me numb. I could not calm down, at hour 2 of me un able to calm down, I asked her if the people could go home because they had already spent the whole day here. It was ""unfair"" to her and I understand that but it felt like I was dying. They stayed the night anyway, and the next day she said that about my medication. It really hurts. She always says that she wants a relationship with me, yesterday she asked me ""for her daughter back"" that hurt. I don't talk to her, because its all fun and dandy but then you will get these random hurtful words. When she saw the bruises on my face, she said that I should live in a program and asked me if I would.

1jfqhd5,mentalhealthsupport,2025-03-20 14:42:23,Forever and always burnt out and can’t function like a normal person,"I’m 18F and I’ve been in college for a month. In the beginning I struggled to get to school on time due to some physical health issue that caused me to sleep though my alarm. I got all that figured out but now I’m late because I’m burnt out. I have adhd and bipolar1. Yeah my school knows about this but I still feel like I will get kicked out. Even if I don’t get kicked out, what happens when a job scout comes and they go “wow she’s great at what she does tell me more”, and an instructor goes “yeah I know she is really good, however she never shows up on time”. ?

The past few days despite having a had a good sleep, I wake up and I’m like, “I can’t do this I’m not going”, and then I sleep in for hours ( in order to get ready and look “presentable” which is something we get graded on and is what job scouts are looking for, I need to wake up very early, and I have a very long bus ride to the school so that contributes to my early early wake up time to). I then usually wake up around or an hour after the time im supposed to have left already, and I still say I’m not doing this, and it takes SO MUCH convincing myself to get myself to go, especially while looking super worn out bc I don’t have time for makeup, and very unprofessional because I don’t have time to style my hair. 

I try to explain being burnt out to my administrators, teachers, classmates, friends, and family, but they don’t get it at all. “ It’s life, you’re tired (beyond drained and exhausted), you still have to try anyway”. But they just don’t know and will never know because they don’t have to experience it. To everyone, I am a lazy cop out who uses their mental health as an excuse to not “adult”.

I don’t know how I’m supposed to succeed in life. I’ve been fired from every job I’ve ever had as a teenager, one of them I got fired from for different reasons, one of them being I looked to drained and un presentable and it was unacceptable ( house keeping, not even a job where I interact with tons of people), when I was barely surviving, trying to make it through school, and just trying to show up to work and get paid, despite my mental illness, and I had bad PTSD at the time from witnessing something intentionally gruesome and violent in person at the time. I barely graduated high school, nobody, not even my parents had thought that that would happen. And I technically but unofficially dropped out in 11th grade and never went during that year.

I’m so exhausted, and I do things like getting lots of sleep, eating right, and stress management but it doesn’t help at all, and everyone around me is judging me for not being able to function properly. I don’t know what to do anymore.

1jas9cz,mentalhealthsupport,2025-03-14 01:17:56,Deleted a Reddit post I made due to criticism,"Hi everyone, I know this is a little dumb compared to everyone else's struggles here, but something happened to me today that made me feel down, sad, and hesistant to make any more posts on Reddit. Long story short, I found this quarter today that had two animals (bats) on the back of it, and I thought it was really cool since I've never seen a quarter with that design engraved into it before. It also had ""national park"" written on it, so I thought it would spark some fun discussion about national park quarters. I was excited to show it off and I thought this would be a cool thing to post on r/mildlyinteresting. Well... I guess I was wrong, because most of the comments I got were met with ""I guess we're posting things like quarters that have anything but an eagle on the back now,"" and ""this isn't even remotely interesting, let alone mildly."" I even got some strangely mean-spirited comments telling me I was late to the party, and then they went on some kind of rant about people making up conspiracy theories related to quarters (as if I was one of those people, I guess)? All because I posted this quarter with a different animal on it. 

I have social anxiety as is, and I know it's stupid to care about what Internet strangers say, but now I feel like such an easily impressed moron who should never post anything that she thinks is cool because she'll get criticized. I've since deleted the post and I'm never going to post on that sub again, but I just don't understand how people can be so strangely judgmental over something so innocuous. Am I the stupid one, though, for thinking it was interesting? Was I wrong for sharing it?

That’s so disrespectful and disgusting to say to those people who have mental health problems, it’s bad enough hiding it from the world and doing what we are supposed to do with our day while we are hurting on the inside, mental health it’s not a fucking choice and it’s not joke, we can’t get rid of, it’s not a cold, we can’t just get rid of it, just because on the outside we look like normal, it don’t mean We are Not hurting, that’s the reason why I am scared to date because as soon they know I have a mental health problem, they would walk away. It’s so hard for me to keep being strong everyday and wake up and pretend to everyone like I am fine and nothing it’s wrong and doing what I am supposed to everyday while I keep hurting on the inside, hiding how I feel emotionally because I keep going through things and I keep hiding my mental health. I have anxiety, social anxiety, depression, eating disorder because I am an emotional and bing eater, learning disability, rejection sensitivity, ADHD, a little bit of ocd, people pleaser, empath, oversharing, adjustment disorder, lots of traumas and cptsd and I have to hide all these because I am so sick and tired of drama happened when I mentioned how I feel emotionally to my family, drama Happened and I end up being alone as always dealing with my own emotions alone and also in my culture and my family and family members, mental health it’s a stigma even when I argue with my mom, she always mentioned how I don’t have mental health problems and have no problems and etc., she have no idea how much I am going through, I keep having to deal with the friendship break up and other Things I am struggling alone like always, and while I keep having to manage my mental health like when I have anxiety attacks, I try to calm myself. I am so tired of people on social media including tick tok hating on mental health when they have no idea what is like to go through it and we can only manage it, we can’t get rid of it, is inside us, we can only manage it, like I have my own coping mechanisms that I do and just because we have mental health, it don’t mean we are awful people or crazy, we are kind and great to hang with Despite Having mental health, like it’s so hard to keep being strong and pretend I am fine while am hurting and going through my emotions alone and being there for myself and having to hide my mental health and how I feel emotionally. Also if no one can accept my mental health then it’s bye and would never talk to this person again because a friend would accept all of you and never judge or hate, a real partner would accept all of you and not judge or hate. no hate, this is Just my opinion

I’ve struggled with depression and suicidal thoughts/attempts as well as sh for most of my life and my partner was aware of this long before we got together. Our relationship is going really well, with no issues between us, so this fear doesn’t really make sense. Still, Im oddly terrified that they might eventually feel like they have to stay with me out of fear that I would kill myself if they left.

I dont think that my partner currently feels trapped Im more worried in a future sense, I dont want it to turn into one of those stories you hear about the crazy ex-gf :( Id also never threaten to hurt myself if they tried to leave but still Im so scared of this. 

Is it normal to have these fears and how do I even deal with them? It’s starting to really get to my head and Idk what to do.

1jb25ov,mentalhealthsupport,2025-03-14 11:56:07,What am I even here for? Helpless.,"Everything feels so pointless lately.

I am a 41/ftm and I've been sick my whole life. I was born 3 and a half months premature and spent the first 6 months of my life in hospital and in those 6 months I died 26 times. I've been sick ever since, and even got ten years to live at 20. I've made it past that which is remarkable to me, but my son left home a few years ago, my mental health and physical health has only worsened. I got married in 2017, and everything I've done has been for her, including improving myself, for myself and for her.

But the more I try the more helpless I feel. No one puts in the same time I put in for them, everyone wants me to improve, but no one puts the same effort into themselves and only expects more and more from me.

Lately I've been bedridden most of the time and my wife quit her job, but I'm still having to get out of bed to clean Ll by myself and I know she's struggling too, but I've finally reXhed my limits and I feel like each day is harder to find reasons to be here and it's not like me. I've been seeing a shrink and I am on multiple medications for depression, anxiety, ADD, autism, and CPTSD. 

What if it never gets better and I keep holding on for nothing? I've never held down a job, I've never finished a course and I'm struggling to keep my physical and mental health balanced.

I used to hold onto the thought that I wanted to wait until I'd be remembered in some way — with my writing, art or by showing someone I loved them. 

When did I give up and why?

I've been through a lot, a lot of mental, sexual, emotional and physical abuse and I everyone I've ever trusted or loved has hurt and abandoned me. Until today, I had felt hope for the future, but tonight is the first time I don't even want to fight. I need to get through this somehow...

1jl97ys,mentalhealthsupport,2025-03-27 17:18:08,"Please, what brings you joy?","TW: Depression/ Suicidal Ideation

I don’t know how to start this, so I’ll cut to the chase. I’ve been struggling with major depression for over 5 years. I feel little identity within myself, and I find that I struggle to make any decisions regarding my own happiness.

I only do things when other people need me to do them. I feel no drive to do anything out of my own volition because, simply put, I don’t know what I want. I used to love drawing, anime, singing, listening to music, hanging out with animals, etc. But now, every time I look at those things, I feel no more interest in them. 

I’ve been struggling with this on and off for over five years, and almost any direct call to my family asking for help has been met with distain. While some family members were initially supportive, later becoming burnt out and unresponsive (which I think is fair, because I would probably feel the same way) others like my dad and uncle claim that I am either “doing it for attention” or that the depression in question no longer exists. My father even went as far to call my antidepressant “poison”. The thing that hurts the most has been hearing from my closest friends, “I’m sorry, but I don’t know how to help”.

I feel absolutely at a loss for what to do. I feel like I’ve done what I’m supposed to. I’ve talked to my family and friends about it, I’ve sought treatment, and I’ve tried about four different medications to help alleviate symptoms. I was even hospitalized as a result of this suicidal ideation. 

Please, even if it’s just little things, what helps you get by? How do you feel motivation? Why is it even worth getting out of bed? I figure that if I just start off with the little things, maybe I can pick myself up.

Now a higher position is available but someone from outside is being recruited with less experience. When this was being discussed infront of me, i couldnt understand how to react. I lost all my consciousness and my behaviour must have changed. It was hard for me to control my facial reactions and whoever was asking me any question, i was not able to give proper answers even for the work i do. Even when people were joking, i wasnt able to enjoy - i was just looking to go home. I was feeling really uncomfortable. Now i feel like knowing nothing, I dont know what to do and how to be present at office from next time. I feel like i have lost all my rapo. Whatever is happening, is it anxiety?

1jh97pp,mentalhealthsupport,2025-03-22 14:07:18,Help me help her,"
We (FF/49&45) have been together for 11 years, 8 of them married. We’ve been through lots of ups & downs life wise but never really relationship wise, we never had a reason to fight or argue, we calmly discussed our problems. We always got along wonderfully, we never stopped going on dates, writing each other sweet notes, chores are ~50/50 depending on who has more time & energy. 
About a 1 ago we started arguing every now & then but it resolved quickly until the arguments repeated again & again,we never really resolved the cause.. mostly issues with jealousy, being afraid I’ll leave her for someone else. Starting with her suddenly getting jealous & seeing everyone I’m close with as trying to get between us, no reason behind it apparently, on the way to a dinner party we argued & when we arrived I went to another friend & left her to go alone, I realize I should’ve handled this more calmly & I apologized for getting louder & leaving, since then it’s not really the same anymore, I don’t know if she got scared or anything, she knows Im not violent, I didn’t scream at her, I know she hates that, but I think she sees small issues as an argument already& getting upset as getting angry.  

She has a history of abusive relationships,went no contact with most family, she was diagnosed with cptsd/gad, battled addiction , suicidal thoughts,all before we met. It was never a problem for our relationship in my eyes, she was always more or less worried it would affect our relationship. Jealousy might have something to do w/ her body dismorphia which I think has been around since the jealousy started. She jumped from one diet to another from time to time. 
When I ask her what’s wrong she either says nothing’ ‘I’m just not feeling well’ ‘I don’t wanna talk about it’ when I ask her friends they say they don’t know, maybe a depressive episode which has happened in the past: she stopped talking to me told me it’s nothing, until a nervous breakdown, I supported her through therapy and everything seemed to be going well, after that we got married, bout two years in a similar episode, but resolved quickly. 

We barely talk sometimes, if we do we argue. Few days we actually act like a couple, I try not to ruin those moments by not mentioning anything about these issues.
I usually do her hair/nails, she asks me to do it, we make put a time, but then tells me she doesn’t feel like it anymore, I make breakfast, plan dates, try to talk to her, nothing from her side, she barely eats some days, she goes to bed at 7pm sometimes and spending much more time in bed.. I have no idea how to save our relationship. I think she thinks  I already decided for myself I’m gonna divorce anyway & there’s no point in doing anything about it. I’m willing to go to any therapy she wants, I suggested couples therapy she said ‘you don’t believe in that anyway’ I said that in the very beginning to a friend, idk how she even remembers that. She said ‘you’ll leave me anyways’ 

When I asked her best friend she said ‘maybe a depressive episode, please stay with her’  (To her friends she seems quite normal, despite being more depressed, she talks to them laughs w/ them, they go out together. ) What if it’s worse than that, last time it was her mom passing away, I would know if someone else passed away, what if it’s a bad diagnosis? Or hers?

It bothered her that I work longer or stay in the car for a while, when she told me that I came home early the whole week but we barely talked & spend the rest of the day in different rooms, following week I worked longer again she complained I don’t wanna come home to her, I told her whats the point if she ignores me, she said nothing & left. Half my friends are apparently flirting with me and wanting to date me, one she even titled as a competition to her. 

For everyone suspecting she cheated, I’d put my hand in fire, she’s the most loyal person I know.   I want to help her but I can’t if she doesn’t want any help or can’t even tell me what’s wrong..
How do I talk to her..

1j5fsv0,mentalhealthsupport,2025-03-07 05:00:19,What should I do,"I made this account for this post because It will allow me to feel comfortable enough to be honest for once.

I’m 21 and I have absolutely no desire to continue living. I remember first feeling this way when I was around 11-12 years old and it’s never gone away, so for me, I’ve lived most of my live depressed. Over those years I’ve taken numerous attempts on my life (taking 2 pill bottles, self harm, and intentionally crashing into a tree to name a few) and my biggest regret each time is that I wasn’t successful. I now eat one meal every couple days because if I eat more than that I throw up (typically fast food). I used to get 8 hours of sleep but I now waste my time sitting in my room all day fantasizing my own death. The last 2 years I’ve only go outside when I get in my car to go to and leave work. And even though I live with my parents, I only  talked to them every couple days, and that’s only because I run into them on my way to my room. I’ve been trying to wait for their deaths so they would Atleast think I’m going to be ok but that seems like it would take too long. I also don’t enjoy talking to people or being around them, so I slowly lost all my “friends” after school.

I know it seems like it can be fixed by eating more, getting 8 hours of sleep, reconnecting with my family and getting therapy. However I tried all these things over the course of 11-12 years (6 therapists and 2 in-patient places) and it only confirmed for me that I shouldn’t be here. I just can’t bring myself to care for anyone around me or even myself (introspection tells me it could be from an absent father). I’ve been chain-smoking and stopped working out to try to deteriorate my health but I by no means want a slow death.

What makes this situation perplexing to me is that my life isn’t particularly bad. I have a good paying job, I save and invest 80-90% of my income, and I’m respected by my peers for my work ethic. I know my parents aren’t the best, but they do what they believe is right and I know that I’m the problem in the equation. 

I feel like I have to pretend to be someone I’m not in order to get through the day. Im unable to trick myself into thinking my life is important or has any meaning even though the people around me can do it easily. I can elaborate on anything if anyone needs more details because I left a lot out that could be important and I want to hear your perspective on why you believe I’m wrong or possibly another way of thinking about it? Because even when everything is going perfect in my life, all I can think about is how I don’t want to be here. 

Any advice is appreciated, but keep in mind I tried therapy, working out, socializing, new job, getting closer with family but it didn’t really help me at all.

1j4pfk6,mentalhealthsupport,2025-03-06 06:37:28,Struggling with my Emotions and Feeling even okay,"I often struggle to talk about how I feel because it feels so heavy. I want to work on putting myself first, but sometimes I feel like I can't be present in my life, which makes it hard to move past certain things. I try to breathe and process my emotions, but I feel stuck and overwhelmed. It's tough to stay calm, and I’m unsure if what I feel is normal. I want to focus on my goals instead of just reacting to my moods, yet I’m scared to let myself feel good about them. 

Sometimes I feel a lot of tension in my body—like in my shoulders and jaw—and I often ignore that pain. I worry I'm not being fully present for my son and that makes me feel guilty, even though I try my best. I wish I knew how to show up for him while navigating my own feelings.

Crying feels like a relief for me right now, but it also reminds me of how long it’s been since I really expressed myself. I want to find a way to share my feelings with a therapist or someone I trust because I want reassurance that I'm okay and that what I feel is just part of life. I fear being seen as crazy for feeling this way, and the idea of needing a mental hospital terrifies me. 

I've been thinking about how to describe my feelings—like how I can go from being really sad to feeling okay so quickly, and I don’t know if that’s normal. I sometimes worry that I'm just rambling without making sense, but talking it out helps me. I want to take time for myself without worrying about what others think. I know I’m just a human feeling things deeply, which is okay. Even though my head hurts because of all the thoughts, crying also makes me feel good in a strange way. 

I’m becoming more aware of my body and how tense it is all the time, which I’ve normalized. It feels like no matter how much I try to relax, I can still feel that stiffness inside me. It helps to acknowledge that I'm going through a lot and gives me hope in processing these feelings. It's okay to feel everything, and I'm learning to accept what I'm experiencing.

1j31lta,mentalhealthsupport,2025-03-04 03:32:36,Struggling to find purpose / reason,"I am 22F. I was recently diagnosed with narcolepsy after struggling with debilitating sleep issues that worsened over the last year. I just started a new med (modafinil) on the 1st for that. I was also \*diagnosed\* with endometriosis in December (did not receive surgery, but met with surgeon to discuss options where she told me she was 100% certain that I had stage 4 bowel endometriosis. I am not able to get the surgery any time soon).I

I've struggled with mental health issues since I was 12 (bipolar 2 and ADHD). I am usually medicated, but had to get off of all of my meds to get the narcolepsy diagnosed. I had to stay off of the medicine in order to take the new medicine for the narcolepsy. 

I am struggling with life right now. Last year, (before both narcolepsy and endometriosis diagnoses) I had a pretty solid plan for my future. I was loving college (sophomore), super excited to pursue my career. I figured out what exactly I want to pursue and where I want to pursue it (marine biology at CSUMB in California), and I was genuinely hopeful and excited for my future. I knew I had health issues, but they were kinda easier to pretend I didn't have because there was no specific diagnosis set in stone. 

 I am pretty poor, but I had just enough in savings to justify moving to the college in California to study (was gonna take out a few loans too). I then got in a minor car accident that cost me about $2000 of my savings, and had other expenses that had to come out of savings vs income. I am full time in school, and I was working two jobs to make ends meet and save money for this future I had planned. I had to quit my one job because it was too physically demanding and I couldn't do it anymore. I now have pretty much 0 hope of ever being able to afford to move to my dream school, and I cannot pursue marine science in the Midwest where I currently live. 

I had also started talking to a guy who I genuinely thought could end up being The One (cheesy, sorry) and it didn't work out due to our busy schedules and just general miscommunication. I told him on my end I was willing to reconnect if he got less busy, but he didn't seem all too interested. I am left feeling even more lonely than before, as I got so hopeful that things would work well because they had been going amazingly the whole time up until the abrupt end. 

Due to the recent health diagnoses, I have struggled in school to the point where I have probably skipped at least 1/3 to 1/2 of all of my classes since January 14th. I am not learning or retaining information, I cant focus, I am too tired from the narcolepsy to even get out of bed to go to class. I am considering doing a medical withdrawal because I just cannot function. 

I am now at one of the lowest points in my life. I lost a lot of my savings, I had to quit a job, I found and lost a potential partner, I don't have a solid support system. (My mom died when I was 15, my dad is abusive and absent, rest of my family doesn't speak to me. I have friends but I feel like I am always a second option or just someone they will talk to/spend time with ONLY if they have no one else. ) I feel like I cannot pursue my dream career, so college feels pointless. I am in pain every day from the endometriosis, but I cannot get surgery because I have no support system or way to pay for my life when taking off work for said surgery. Plus, my case is complex in the sense of they cannot guarantee me that surgery would help at all. I am constantly exhausted too, and I have barely gotten enough sleep since January 10th when I started weaning off my meds to begin the narcolepsy diagnostic journey. 

I know being off of my mental health meds is seriously screwing me up and making me catastrophize. But I genuinely sit here and feel like my life has fallen apart. The only thing that keeps me going is that I have a dog and a cat who need me to care for them. I just genuinely have nothing super positive to hold onto, nothing fun or exciting to hold onto. I am just surviving, and I am so sad all the time. 

I am not sure what I am trying to gain from this, but I just feel so painfully alone. I feel like I could disappear and nobody would be affected. I just wish there was a solution to any of my problems but I cannot figure anything out. I am so young and I am so hopeless, and I don't know what to do anymore. 

I am just so tired. I wish I had someone in my life who would be there with me through this, who could go to DR appointments and hold me when I am falling apart. I don't have anyone for that. I try to talk to people about this stuff but I can tell it overwhelms them, so I have been trying not to talk about it as much. I have never had a support system though, so I have not really processed much of the issues in my life. 

It just feels like no matter how hard I try, things keep getting worse. I don't know what other steps to take beyond the ones I am currently taking. I guess this is a rant, because I don't know what anyone else could offer me in terms of solutions. Life is hard. 

**What I am doing to try and help myself:** treating narcolepsy with modafinil, but the side effects so far are brutal. treating endometriosis with pelvic floor therapy, general pain meds, supplements, but it doesn't help much. I have a therapist for general issues, and a new therapist for relationship issues (the situation with the guy really messed me up more than it should, and made me seek treatment for my previous traumatic experiences). I am going to try to get on a new mood stabilizer for my bipolar, and I am hoping the modafinil helps the ADHD due to it being a stimulant. I am trying to focus on my hobbies and start new ones. I have also bought some books and am trying to start journaling again.

1jly3y7,mentalhealthsupport,2025-03-28 15:45:19,I'm really not okay.,"
(TW! Mentions of self harm and sexual assault) 

Let me just start by saying I have been assaulted 4+ times in my life and in the back of my mind there's always a thought saying ""it has to be your fault at this point, NOBODY gets assaulted THAT many times"" and it hurts. My most recent one ended with me having a miscarriage to a r@pe baby. From my main assaulter, we'll call this person Neptune. (Neptune is not their real name) I was in love with Neptune for so long and from what they told me, they were in love with me too. The first assault with them started in seventh grade, they were a sophomore in high school. 

I wont give many details on the assault because it's a well known story of that person and people I know might find this post. But it happened at a party, and after I was traumatized to say the least. This person I had loved for so long had completely violated me. I still talked to them for a while after that. It was really hard to break away from them because of the trauma bond that had formed after that incident. But months later I finally did, after I had successfully blocked them I didn't talk to them for months.More than a year, but we went to the same school now, I was a freshman and she was a senior. I knew we would eventually cross paths and I was fully prepared to defend myself from her if she tried anything. But I grew weak. My friends and I would go to a local library after school every day and Neptune also went there. 

I tried to ignore her presence at first but we kept staring at each other. And I remember one day my friend waved to Neptune, they knew what had transpired a year ago but they had asked for permission to interact with Neptune because they liked her outfit. I was okay with it but I didn't know this would cause Neptune to come back into my life. This friend of mine let's call him Agreste. He wanted Neptune's number and after a lot of asking eventually I caved and gave it to him. This then led to me thinking, ""maybe Neptune's changed! It's been so long!"" and I spent ages trying to come up with a reason to text them, which I eventually did (how dumb of me I know) and for a while, I mean a really long while, things were great! I really thought they had changed... But Neptune did not change. 

During a day in which we were both heading to the school because of a mandatory performance (both of us were in Choir) we were talking and she texted me saying if I see her going somewhere alone I should follow her so we could talk. I payed no mind to it at first but when it came the time during the show where I saw her going up the school stairs alone and she motioned for me to follow her, I knew I had to make a choice. I mad the wrong choice and I regret it to this day. The things she did to me in that school bathroom were horrible and vile. I hate myself and my body after that event. I ended up pregnant and miscarried after. She didn't care. But because of that pregnancy I met someone amazing. 

My current partner, we'll call him Luca. He provided me with a plan b pill a couple days after the incident. (Obviously it didn't work but I felt so safe and seen after that) That was my first encounter with him. From that day on, I was attached. And we started dating later that month. I realize now that we never got to really know each other. We never had deep conversations or experiences with each other. Since Neptune I haven't been able to heal because I instantly fell in love and continued living life. And for a while it really did help! I was even encouraged to report the assault and now I'm going through the process of prosecution, but the truth is I'm not okay. 

I haven't been to school in weeks. My grades are shit. My boyfriend feels unloved. I feel like shit. My main reason for coming on here is because of my mental health. Neptune has completely broken me. She has used me for her own pleasure and manipulated me because I am naive and young. It hurts. I am broken. I can't even speak and this reason alone is what's tearing apart my relationship. I can't handle questions anymore. I am so hypersensitive and I don't know why this is all crashing down on me so suddenly. Every time my partner asks me a question I respond with ""I don't know."" And I really don't know. I have become so indecisive and confused I don't know anything. 

If Im asked a lot of questions that aren't yes or no then I start clawing at my legs, subconsciously scratching at my skin because it drives me crazy hearing questions, all I can say is I don't know and then when he doesn't want to hear I don't know I just start sobbing. And hurting myself. Today I started hitting my phone against my bed frame. I had a burst of outrage. And I feel so numb. I feel like I'm nothing anymore. All I can PHYSICALLY say is ""I don't know."" That's all I know how to say. I feel like I need to learn how to talk again. I don't know what's wrong with me. My response to this trauma is breaking me when I'm already broken. It's not just hurting me, it's hurting my relationship. I need help and I am not okay. I can't ask to go to a mental hospital because I'm scared. I can't ask for help and I don't know what to do.. I don't know anything anymore. 

To clarify something really quickly; My assaulter is transfem, she was born a male but transitioned to a female. She still has her pee pee stick though which is how I ended up pregnant. 

I am just lost with myself and I have no idea what to do. I can't eat. I can't sleep. I can't get up and shower or even brush my teeth. I just want to be happy again. I want to be happy with him again..

1jkwenj,mentalhealthsupport,2025-03-27 05:01:46,"Is there any coming back from untreated long-term psychosis, and if so, how to help someone who doesn't want it?","I'll try to keep this as short as I can, but I want to make sure to give enough context. My brother (43M) was diagnosed with biopolar disorder in his late teens, and after a very rough several years, he really improved in his late 20s and had been largely stable without medication. He and I live several states away, but we've kept in regular contact, especially the last 3 years.

About 22 months ago (summer 2023), he experienced a traumatic event that I now believe may have triggered the beginning of psychosis. He started talking about very dark and concerning things he ""remembered"" from childhood that at the time I couldn't say with certainty were false, but seemed very unlikely to be true. I may have interrupted an attempt at him taking his own life a few weeks after. A few months after that (Oct 2023) he and I did a long camping trip together and had a very nice time, and he had seemed to be back to normal.

Last summer (June 2024) there was another triggering event that made him lash out at my father and cut off communication, which was very sad, but it wasn't the first time he'd gone no-contact because they have a difficult relationship. I've had to be careful since then to avoid the topic because my brother was very angry and blames my dad for difficulties in his own life (which is partially true).

Over the last several weeks, he's been under increasing amounts of stress due to his job contract nearing an end and not having any success finding another opportunity. He believes it's because of my dad that he will lose his job and hasn't been able to find another one (required background checks and some legal trouble my dad got into a long time ago, but my brother has had his own legal troubles as well). He is the sole breadwinner because his partner does not currently work (although he could), and they have a large number of pets to care for. 

A few days ago, we were texting back and forth about lighthearted things and he seemed okay until the conversation started to veer into negative territory. I made a clumsy attempt at changing the subject, and in doing so managed to deeply offend him when saying something that under any normal circumstances would have been easily recognized as a joke. He sent me a picture of a gift I'd gotten him decades prior broken on the floor and told me he didn't know if he wanted to talk to me anymore. I texted his partner to tell him I was concerned about my brother's mental health and asked him to lock up their guns.

The next morning, my brother sent an extremely long email ranting about why he couldn't forgive me and listing out multiple detailed false memories in which myself and both my parents had either emotionally or physically abused him over the years. He referred to himself as an orphan and said he wanted nothing to do with us anymore. I again texted his partner to express grave concern, asked him to look after my brother, and let him know that he can reach out to me if he needs anything. I emailed my brother to apologize for offending him, to explain that I never meant to give the impression I had, and to tell him that I loved him no matter what, but would respect if he needed to take a break. (I did not attempt to refute the false memories because I knew it would not be well-received.)

I messaged my mom to let her know what was going on and suggested she try and continue casually texting with him, but to be prepared in case he decided to push her away as well. To both our surprise, he has continued to respond to her as though nothing is wrong, which gave me hope. But last night, he responded to my email by re-iterating how awful our family is and saying that he would only consider speaking to me again if he managed to keep his job. If his job contract ends with no prospects, he is planning on ending things and had instructed his partner to send prepared letters to each of myself and my parents only after his funeral had passed.

I don't know what to do. Part of me thinks he's so far gone that there's nothing to be done except wait for that awful letter in the mail, and part of me thinks I'm giving up too easily and I need to try and fight to change his mind. But what would I even say? He has no idea that he's so unwell, and seems to believe I'm one of his many tormentors. His partner is timid and passive, and I can't rely on him to intervene.

1jko8n8,mentalhealthsupport,2025-03-26 22:11:22,Hello any help would be appreciated sorry it’s so long,"Hello I hope this belongs here i posted on multiple pages for any help or info I am a 22 about to be 23 year old male living in south jersey (Cherry hill area) and I am struggling and don’t know where to start any help or tips or guidance would be so appreciated and needed. I am just trying to be a better person and husband. I apologize in advance for any spelling errors or weirdly worded sentences I’m trying but it’s really hard to get my thoughts on paper.

(Some background on my life my father passed away about a month ago tbh it didn’t quite affect me really my father was a bad dude sold drugs and was in prison half my life my mother passed when I was 7 I loved her but now a days I don’t remember her much at all and when I see pictures of her I almost don’t know who it is. My family is pretty messed most of them are either on drugs or on the news for selling them/hurting people. Most of the men in my family are in gangs including my father and he was there when I was jumped in that was the most proud I ever seen him. I was in foster care for a while and then adopted when I was 9/10 to a terrible family who treated me and the other kids they adopted like house slaves… I’m talking every door in the house locked,pantry locked .some of the adopted kids wernt even allowed to to eat at the same time as the family. I left there when I was 16 and got emancipated shortly after. I am not alone I found a friend and over time he became my brother and his mom took me in as her own calls me son shows me off on Facebook with her other kids she loves me. I have people in my corner they are just not sure how to help and I’m not even sure how to help myself or where to begin honestly I’m hoping a lot of people see this and are able to toss some suggestions my way.

This is What is happening 

I can’t focus on multiple things I can’t multi task I end up forgetting steps or forgetting a task all together 

I can’t keep up with responsibilities or bills because my focus can only be on one thing 

I am feeling so frustrated and irritated all the time now very little happy moments 

I’ve only been eating one meal a day for about 2 or 3 months now losing my hunger for food I only eat when my stomach starts to hurt 

Getting out of bed in the mornings is a losing battle every time I’m late to work damn near everyday 

I feel like I’ve been declining and now one can help me and it won’t get better I was hopeful in the beginning that I would feel better I no longer have that hope I hate everyday 

All I wanna do is lay in bed and sleep all day but I can’t sleep even tho I’m exhausted I’m exhausted everyday even after waking up from a lot off sleep

I am randomly super anxious at random points in the day and I’m not sure what brings on such a heavy unsettling feeling like something is wrong 

Remembering to take medication or remembering I have an appointment is damn near impossible I forget as soon as I’m told 

My procrastination has gotten so bad I will save something intill the absolute last second and then be extremely upset that I am feeling rushed 

I never did well in school because I can’t just sit still and have someone speak to me my body won’t stop moving whether it’s twirling my fingers or shaking my legs",3,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/MentalHealthSupport/comments/1jko8n8/hello_any_help_would_be_appreciated_sorry_its_so/,Hello help would appreciated sorry long Hello hope belongs posted multiple pages help info 22 23 year old male living south jersey Cherry hill area struggling dont know start help tips guidance would appreciated needed trying better person husband apologize advance spelling errors weirdly worded sentences Im trying really hard get thoughts paper background life father passed away month ago tbh didnt quite affect really father bad dude sold drugs prison half life mother passed 7 loved days dont remember much see pictures almost dont know family pretty messed either drugs news selling themhurting people men family gangs including father jumped proud ever seen foster care adopted 910 terrible family treated kids adopted like house slaves Im talking every door house lockedpantry locked adopted kids wernt even allowed eat time family left 16 got emancipated shortly alone found friend time became brother mom took calls son shows Facebook kids loves people corner sure help Im even sure help begin honestly Im hoping lot people see able toss suggestions way happening cant focus multiple things cant multi task end forgetting steps forgetting task together cant keep responsibilities bills focus one thing feeling frustrated irritated time little happy moments Ive eating one meal day 2 3 months losing hunger food eat stomach starts hurt Getting bed mornings losing battle every time Im late work damn near everyday feel like Ive declining one help wont get better hopeful beginning would feel better longer hope hate everyday wan na lay bed sleep day cant sleep even tho Im exhausted Im exhausted everyday even waking lot sleep randomly super anxious random points day Im sure brings heavy unsettling feeling like something wrong Remembering take medication remembering appointment damn near impossible forget soon Im told procrastination gotten bad save something intill absolute last second extremely upset feeling rushed never well school cant sit still someone speak body wont stop moving whether twirling fingers shaking legs
1jk3pek,mentalhealthsupport,2025-03-26 04:30:52,Has anyone experienced this,"Hi all, I’ve never posted on Reddit before or asked for online advice but I figured I’d give it a go. For most of my life I’ve had waves of obsessive (not implying I have OCD, just in nature) spirals of negative thoughts, either falling into the category of “I am a bad person” or “This cannot be changed.” If that doesn’t make much sense- I either hyper-fixate on things I’ve done or qualities I used to have, things I can rationally understand are part of childhood and growing up, but I try to convince myself I am in some way tainted as a human being because of them. Or, I hyper focus on something, usually about a romantic partner, once in a while a friend, that I cannot change about them. I am usually able to do this in silence and not let this specific thought process impact my relationships, but the depression and anxiety brought on from my internal spirals usually effects the relationship in some form. The hard part is I have rational breaks from my thoughts when I feel “normal,” and less hyperfixated, and I feel relieved and then panicked about how I acted, was perceived, or if others were able to tell the amount of distress I felt on the inside. But usually those are short lived breaks. I don’t know if this makes sense to anyone, or if they’ve experienced something similar. I have a great therapist and am currently trying to figure out medications, and have been trying to do a lot to take care of myself and my mental health. It’s just this thought process that I can’t seem to escape from, and was wondering if anyone else had insights.

1jg4sgg,mentalhealthsupport,2025-03-21 00:57:04,Truly Struggling,"I’ve struggled for as long as I can remember with anxiety and over thinking. I lost my mother to suicide when I was 14 but I still think I was an anxious being way before that. As of late, I am really struggling and I just feel like every day is a new giant challenge just to get over. I am 22 and just graduated college this past December and started a job in early February that has brought me a lot of stress and questions about what I want to do with my career. I know it’s early and normal to not know and to just be patient, but none of this advice helps me in the moment. 

I separated with my boyfriend last September as well after two years and we lived together so that was messy. In the last year I’ve gained about 30 pounds. I felt tired, hopeless, sad, exhausted, and just burnt out and lost all the time. I don’t feel like there is hope for a better future or that I can lose weight and feel confident in my body again. I’ve started dating someone new about 2 months ago and it’s been really good I just struggle a lot with feeling like he’s constantly mad at me. I express this to him and there’s no reason to feel that way, it’s just my anxiety. I don’t like to turn to him for all my troubles. Especially cause we are so new. 

I’ve tried Prozac, Wellbutrin, sleeping meds, etc. I’m currently taking phentermine to help me lose weight. I really just don’t know what to do to make life better.

As someone who used to struggle with depression, my own ‘ death ‘ has no meaning anymore, since ive looked death right in its eyes . 
So back to the song, i have a pretty bad memory due to trauma, so just suddenly remembering the absolute desperation, loneliness and depression i felt all at once just somehow reminded me how that never changed, i just learned how to live with it, and with myself for being that way .
I have to do things on daily basis just to keep myself in check / to not ever go back to that stage .

Over the past year, I feel like my anxiety has only grown. I feel like I try to do what seems right at the time but later feels like the wrong thing. I feel like a weirdo sometimes at work because I overthink what i’m going to say to the point I stutter. I have experienced a lot of trauma since 2020 and it feels like my life did a complete 180. I look back and feel like I was so much more happier and confident in myself and somehow along the lines I lost all of it. Sometimes I have complete meltdowns and it seems like my emotions are always on extremes. I feel like a total asshole and jerk and I really want to be better and do better. My fear of being a bad person has become a total obsession and I feel like it consumes me. My anxiety is so overwhelming and I constantly freak out about it. 

My partner recently switched to night shift and I work mornings so we don’t see each other until late at night briefly and the weekends. The first month I had complete breakdowns because I was so worried someone would break in. I couldn’t take a shower without constantly checking the house. I still can’t sleep in the bedroom until he comes home! Now that the anxiety of a break in has gone away, i’m always sitting my thoughts and overthinking my life and what it means to be a good person.

1j60jnh,mentalhealthsupport,2025-03-07 21:22:31,My parents have hurt me the most in my life.,"I am writing this because I am deeply hurt. 

My heart aches thinking about my situation.
I have never told this to anyone.

After years of having these feelings, I am writing this post to seek advice. 

I really need help. I feel like I am dying inside.

I am 26, male.
In childhood and teen days I have faced a lot of hate, abandonment from my parents.

Age: 9 to 15
I(assume I am Ram) was not a bright student, I used to get average grades in school. Due to this I faced a lot of shouting and somtimes beating from my parents.

My brother(lets call him Shyam) on the other hand used to score way above average scores. Due to this he got a lot of love. He got a lot of recognition in family both on nani and dadi side. 
People used to say Shyam kitna acha hai padhne me, Ram toh bekar nikammma ladka hai.
My brother was also usually very sick, maybe because of that he got more love and sympathy from my parents.

Whenever me and my brother had a dispute my parents always took my brother's side.

They used to shout at me and I used to get angry and irritated. 

Age: 15 to 21
My mother even told my brother not to talk to me. Even my mother stopped talking to me multiple times. How can a mother do this? 

These situation was not just once and twice, this used to happen frequently. 

Even my father used to shout at me on lots of things. When we have an argument then he also just stopped talking to me multiple times. 

Once my father stopped talking to me for 11 days. Can you imagine, you and your father are living in a same house, sitting in same rooms, seeing each other daily but your father is not talking to you?

And these situations used to repeat frequently. My respect for both my parents went down a lot. I even left my home once after argument with my parents.

These situations led me to do bad things like weed, cigarette, etc.

I kept smoking cigarette for years but now I have quit.

Around age 21-22:
In lockdown, due to bad economic condition at my home I decided that I will start studying and get a good job.

After some time of my graduation I got a really good job and starting earning very well.

After the job, I didn't face much shouting or arguments from my parents.

It just slowed down and my parents started respecting me. 

Around age 25:
Now I face very minimal argument or shouting from my parents side.

But we still have arguments. When we have arguments, my mind just goes back to the previous memories of my parents shouting at me, not talking to me for days, telling my brothers not to talk to me and so on.

Even small arguments or shouting triggers these feelings and brings back memories.

These are my parents who treated me like this, the two people who should always be on your side treated me like this? why did they shout at me? Why did they stopped talking to me? Why did they leave me lonely?
And now maybe I am earning, their attitude have changed towards me? Why?

Why did my parents did not sit down with me and talked to me when we had an argument? Why did my parents tried to solve things rather than not talking me to?

These memories are very hurting, I just keep thinking about these feelings. I feel so empty inside. I have started to not like my father, even though I love him. I automatically don't like talking to him.

Maybe I was at fault for not scoring good marks and arguing with my parents, that is why they treated me like this?

I don't know. 

I want to be proven wrong but I can't find a good enough reason.

This is really affecting my mental health. 
I want to remove these negative feelings.

1j0jjvu,mentalhealthsupport,2025-02-28 22:00:30,"It’s my 23th Birthday today, I feel lost","My name is Aisha, and today I turned 23. I’m from the Netherlands, and for the past two years, I’ve been struggling with severe depression. I could explain how it all developed, but maybe that’s a story for another time. Right now, I feel like I’ve hit the peak—or rather, the lowest point—of it.

The smallest change in someone’s behavior, a subtle remark, or a small shift in tone… and I can dwell on it for an entire week. Overthinking it, analyzing every little detail. It keeps me up at night. And when I say that, I mean it literally. I haven’t been able to sleep properly for two years. I go entire nights without rest, running on maybe two hours of sleep before heading to work.

University? That hasn’t been an option for a while. I haven’t attended in over a year and a half. Not because I don’t want to, but because I’m too afraid. And that’s what’s been running through my head for two years: I’m afraid. Afraid to choose myself. Afraid to love myself. Afraid to show myself to others—or, sometimes, I show too much.

Ironically, the only thing I managed to hold onto during these two years of depression was work. I kept going, even when it felt impossible. And now, even that is gone. This week, I was told my temporary contract would not be renewed. That’s life, I guess. But I honestly didn’t see it coming. My position in the company was strong. I know that. They promised me growth. They told me they wanted to keep me—just a month ago. If that’s not the case, then at the very least, I should have been given transparency.

This is depression. Objectively, losing a job isn’t the end of the world. I’m young. I can find another job. I’ve been in a leadership position, which looks good on my resume. But that’s not what really bothers me. What truly worries me is that this job was the only reason I ever went outside.

Friendships? I’ve let them go the way you cancel a subscription. Did that make me sad? Yes. Am I still sad about it? Absolutely. Do I still open up to people? Sometimes. But do I ever really get that effort back? Rarely.

It feels like no matter what I do…

I’m too much. Or not enough.
I try too hard. Or not hard enough.
Am I too kind? Or too distant?
Too loud? Or too quiet?
Too assertive? Or too passive?

Nothing feels right. Everything is something to worry about. Everything is something to overthink at night. And so, I don’t sleep.

And today, on my birthday, it was all too much. I’ve had multiple panic attacks, and my body is completely exhausted from the anxiety. I feel drained—mentally and physically.

Did life pass me by? I’m 23. I’m supposed to be in the prime of my life. So why doesn’t it feel that way?

As a teen, I knew exactly who I was and where I was going. I had ambitions. I knew who I was. I knew who I was. Maybe that’s why I made it so far in school. But I did it all alone. There was no space for me at home. I don’t blame anyone, but now I’m here, lost. What do you do when you no longer know who you are? What you want? What your purpose is? When everything you’ve been through has left you completely drained?

A 23-year-old doesn’t need a big celebration for their birthday. But honestly, today didn’t feel like a celebration at all. Today felt… I don’t even know what word to use. Today just felt awful.

It might surprise you, but I spent my 22nd birthday in a hospital. No one came. Except for one friend. Maybe I should have known then that no one would reach out this year either. But part of me still hoped that someone would check in. Not just a quick “happy birthday,” but someone genuinely asking how I was doing. Maybe then, I could have stressed about how to respond. About how to say, “Hey, I’m doing fine. How are you?”

My birthday last year changed something in me. I was hospitalized.That moment broke something inside me. The feeling of loneliness and fear is perhaps the very core of depression. Depression is hard to deal with. But the worst part of it is this: being afraid.

Afraid to do something.
Afraid to try.
Afraid to live.

I don’t know exactly why I’m writing this here. Maybe just to get it out of my head. Maybe someone will read this and see themselves in it. Or maybe it’s just a way to remind myself that I’m still here.

1jmgbie,mentalhealthsupport,2025-03-29 06:34:39,Help,"Thoughts? -What do you do when you’re alone with no one to talk to? You talk to yourself. And I’ve been so alone that my own voice became a knife in the silence that surrounded me. It felt foreign and sharp in contrast to the empty space I constantly occupied. So instead of talking to myself, I write online, typing thoughts like confessions into the void in the hopes that someone, anyone, might echo back something other than the pain Im trying to exorcise from myself.

Depression doesn’t always look like pale skin, dark circles, and messy hair. Sometimes, it looks like a perfectly normal girl sitting  in her living room, doing everything she can to seem fine. I’ll never forget the stranger who came to my apartment one night. It was supposed to be a date, but I canceled in the most honest way I could because I was simply, utterly exhausted from hiding that I was not okay. I hadn’t been okay for a long time, and I couldn’t pretend I was anymore . I told him I was struggling with thoughts of suicide and couldn’t bring myself to leave my apartment.  he asked if he could still come over—if I would still have him. I remember staring at that message, thinking maybe he hadn’t actually read mine, or at least not all of it. So I asked again, plainly—did you see what I said? Did you see what I said? That I’m not okay. That I’m struggling to stay alive today. He hadn’t. He missed the part where I confessed the weight I’d been carrying. When he finally read it, I told him that I wouldn’t hold it against him if he chose not to come. And I had meant it I know people feel pressure in these moments—there’s a sense of panic, of moral responsibility. Most people don’t want someone to end their life, but they also don’t know what to say or how to be in the room with that kind of truth. And honestly, I’m glad some people don’t understand. Even if it’s why people like me are often judged or dismissed or met with awkward silence—it means they haven’t had to carry this weight. And I wouldn’t wish it on anyone. This isn’t romantic. It’s not poetic. It’s not  martyrdom , or some glamorous kind of sadness. It’s a slow rot. It’s something that gnaws at the foundation of you until your body remains but you’re no longer inside it. It’s destructive. And when he said he still wanted to come over, I let him. I didn’t clean up or change. I stayed in the same clothes I’d been wearing. When I opened the door, I tried to keep my face neutral, blank not for me, but for him. I didn’t want to make him uncomfortable. I was numb. My body was tired. My spirit felt worn through. The apartment was dim, too quiet, too still like a tomb. I had moved my life into the living room because the bedroom felt like it was swallowing me whole. There was no clutter, just a hollowed-out kind of order—essentials and nothing more. When he looked at me, the first thing he said was, “You don’t look like someone struggling with wanting to die.” And something in me flinched. I didn’t know what I had expected, but it wasn’t that. For a second I wondered, Is that what people think? When they see me? When they see anyone? What does someone look like when they’re collapsing inside? I looked him in the eye and asked, “Is there some way you have to look to feel that way?” Depression doesn’t wear a uniform. It doesn’t always show up in ways you can see. Sometimes it looks like chaos. Sometimes it looks like disintegration. And sometimes it looks just like i did that night standing blank-faced at the door, breathing through dying on the inside while trying not to make it weird for the guy standing on the welcome mat.
At the lowest points of my depression, it’s wild to me that it was when  I received the most compliments on my appearance. I was the thinnest I had ever been, and that includes the times when I was deep in active eating disorders and drug abuse. I went from 210 pounds down to 120 in four months. I’d look at myself in the mirror and i could no longer  recognize the hollowed-out person looking back at me.  My body matched what i felt like inside, like I was shrinking out of my life. People smiled at me like wasting away was an accomplishment I was now achieving . No one saw the  screaming that the change really was . they just saw someone who had been overweight becoming skinny. And that was “a good thing.” I was praised for silently drowning. 

I understand how helpless it feels to care about someone who’s suicidal. You want to help. You want to take their pain away. But you can’t. I know that powerlessness. But I also know what it’s like to be on the other side, to be silently pleading for someone to see me. To not tell me my feelings are wrong. To not tell me I’m overreacting. I can’t tell you how many times I’ve said, “I don’t feel loved,” and people have rushed to say, “But you are loved,” “There are people who love you,” as if my suffering was something I choose to feel As if I were being dramatic. Ungrateful. Blind to what’s right in front of me.

I’ve stood in both places. And I still can’t tell you definitively what the right way to be is. But what  I can say is: sometimes the right thing isn’t a thing at all. It’s simply presence. just… someone actively being there. 

I get that many people don’t know how to sit with me in my pain. But God… I wonder do they ever step outside their own skin even for a moment, to wonder what it’s like for me to live in it? I can’t escape it. I can’t soothe it. It doesn’t stay stuffed away. It’s always there, persistent, aching, taking the coloring from everything. No one can see it. And that’s its own kind of pain. Because I feel it… but their criticisms of how I react to what they think just doesn’t exist makes me question if I’m even really feeling it at all. Until I begin to gaslight myself
I can’t describe to you the tragedy of experiencing so much humanity within myself, and yet being convinced I’m fabricating it. Like it’s if I’m stabbing myself and crying for help, but everyone’s too busy pointing out that the knife is in my hand to notice that I’m bleeding out.

I know everyone has something going on that no one else knows about. We’re all stumbling through this life for the first time. And none of us really knows what we’re doing here. Sometimes, that thought comforts me. It softens the sting when people let me down. Other times, it makes me feel completely bleak and nihilistic. Because I know, no one is coming to save me. And no matter how hard I try, I can’t seem to save myself.

I don’t blame anyone.

1jljevy,mentalhealthsupport,2025-03-28 01:18:50,My psychiatrist is threading to “expose” me to my parents,"Hey guys i’m in a bit of a situation and I want to know how to navigate this. Background info i’m 20f and currently i’ve been withdrawn from school. Around a month ago i tried taking my life. I was withdrawn from school but i wasn’t made aware of it until 3 weeks in and we already found a place for me to stay. Basically the issue is i’m not in school but i’m living in an apartment paid by my parents for me to be close to school. Now me not being enrolled is on me, i had a horrible incident that i won’t get into details but long story short, horrible experience in my first year (witnessing sewer slide, attempted murder, abuse etc.) all on my own it caused me to not perform well in my classes and i was incredibly mentally i’ll - i’m not making that an excuse for my faliures but just the reason and i take full accountability of it. ( I can always clarify if you guhs have questions). This issue is, i cannot tell my parents, that’s literally a non-negotiable i’ve tried and it never ends well. My parents are indian immigrants and they’ve worked their butts off for me, please know i feel guilty about it all the time, i appreciate their help so much but they also are not the type to understand mental health and the second they get angry they don’t care. (ex. mom blamed brothers depression on me, told me dad once i was suicidal when i was younger and. he comforted me for him to then deny that ever happening and that i have no reason to feel that way and it’s my fault). What i’m trying to say is I can’t tell them that i have severe depression, anxiety and ptsd that resulted in my failing because to them that wouldn’t be an excuse. You guys might try to convince me and maybe this is where i’m being dense but i just know my parents and it wouldn’t work. They are not open minded at all, and to a getter their anger is justified becuase i’ve wasted all their hard earned money even though yes it was out of my control i still could’ve done something, i shouldn’t have been so weak. Onto why I’m making this post, when i tried, i was found by my mom and taken to the hospital. There they kept me overnight and i explained this exact situation to my psychiatrist and nurses. However when i had my meeting with my psychiatrist he told me he’s going to tell my parents there and then, i managed to convince him not to but he followed up with saying that I need to meet him in a month (currently now in like a week or so-ish) and if i haven’t told them, he’s going to send an anonymous message to my mom saying i failed uni. Now here’s the issue, i absolutely understand that in his pov this is the safest route for me but i know my family will be ruined with this info and my parents will lose it. I’ve reflected and i know that this isn’t something i want to die over so i’ll relay that info to my psychiatrist but i also somehow need to explain that after he threatened me with telling me parents, i tried this month to hint at my situation and they’ve completely shut it down. They act like what happened didn’t ever happen. My mom has blamed me and made it about herself, just very typical i don’t believe in mental health actions. But i wanted to know, I also understand there is pt confidentiality systems set in place and him threatening only just increased my anxiety. The whole time we spoke he only continued to shame me and my feelings and mitigate them. I understand having a blunt and real approach is sometimes necessary for pts but he was completely rude and dismissive. I’m really nervous that when i go back he’s going to ignore what i say and put me into a bigger problem, i feel very lost i don’t know where to post this or where to go. If anyone has advice i’ll greatly appreciate it. I know it might seem confusing and i apologize but i will do my best to clarify anything and if you guys know where else i could post this for help too.

1jkulsz,mentalhealthsupport,2025-03-27 03:16:31,I can’t help but lose everyone and it’s killing me,"I’m losing everyone, and it’s all my fault. I couldn’t keep them around, I couldn’t keep her around. My dear Eme, she was too good for me, I never treated her as she deserved. She loved me so dearly and I rejected her glances, her beautiful smiles and her kind looks. Her love that overwhelmed my heart and my mind. How far I have fallen, I never had confidence. I was 17 5’8 and I weighed 217lbs, I had to change to survive, I was on the verge of giving up and I lacked any confidence, I still do. I grew up sheltered, my mom could never afford to take us out but she tried her best, she always tried to take us out. I grew up in a home in the Florida suburbs where everything is far and we couldn’t really do much, my parents got the house after the market crash and my dad was jumping job to job, my parents noticed I was different when I was little. They used to hit me a lot until my mom I was diagnosed with ADHD at age 7. My mom tried her best to help me but I never did well in school and after my sister was hospitalized when I was 12 I never really recovered. I got fat, I became more socially awkward and I never had female interaction. When i was finishing my senior year I decided to make a change, I lost weight and changed my appearance, but I was still the same person. I did everything alone, I ate alone, I slept alone, I went to prom alone, I rotted alone. As soon as I turned 18 I enlisted in the Marine Corps and I met Eme. Everything was going for me, we started dating and eventually we both left for boot camp. Boot camp was tougher for me since I was in a “toxic” company. It was much more difficult mentally and physically, I thought the Marine Corps would make me a man, that it will complete me and change me but I’m still the same kid I was prior to joining. My SDI told me I was a man but I was still a kid in his eyes, he said we were all his little brothers in his eyes and that we were all kids. He is a great man, he is my idol but I can’t even keep up. My DI said once “before a Marine I am a Man”, I can’t help but think to myself and ask what am I?. I don’t know what I am. I’m still that fat kid who cried alone at night, that same kid who had no friends. I don’t know what I am. I’m nothing, Ronald Regan once said “Some people spend an entire lifetime wondering if they made a difference in this world. The Marines don't have that problem”, but I read that and think what a lie that is. What is my purpose? I have none, my mother keeps me going. I’m still a kid, but I’m a also a Marine a Rifleman, before a Marine what am I, what do I have. I have nothing. I am nothing, I’m worthless, there are so many people who wish they had the chance I got and they would give everything just to be in my shoes. In MCT I got strep, my fever soared Andy throat was closing, I asked a SSGT for the corpsman and I collapsed. I went into shock in the back of JLTV speeding towards a ambulance and I couldn’t help but close my eyes, I felt so cold, my left eye was going dark, I saw dark spots slowly grow and the corpsman kept sternum rubbing me and telling me to stay awake, stay awake kid. Even then I was a kid, all I could think about was my mom. The Lt colonel came to visit me in the hospital and I asked him if my mom was notified that I was there and he said not yet and if I wanted to call her, I told him no, I couldn’t let her know I was weak and I failed. He said it wasn’t my fault but I still asked him to not tell my mom. I could only cry for my mom in silence under a blanket, I was so cold. I was a kid all over again. My dear Eme always took care of me, even in sickness she was there, she left me on a Friday afternoon, “your too immature, you promised to change and you haven’t”, “your still a kid”. I can’t help but think what if I kept my eyes closed, what if he looked away for just a second and let me submit into the cold dark peace. I have come to realize she was my everything. I’m sorry for not appreciating you. My friends told me to go on dating apps and I tried but I was too scared to talk to new people. My friends say I have everything going for me, women have told me I’m attractive, I’m 18, 5’10, in Great shape and I hold a great title. But in the inside I’m still a kid although I have the body of a man and went through trails and tribulations that men have failed in. What am I, our 2nd Lt tells us after every PT that we are worthy and we are loved, that we must seek and show love, joy, peace and patience. It’s like God sent an angel to tell me to not give up. What am I?. I’m just another body for the Corps, just another number, I don’t see myself growing up, my sister said I’m growing up that’s it. But what is my purpose. I lose all my friends. I’m desperate for help and I do everything in silence, with sadness and pain. I’m so young and I have accomplished something that only 1% have but what is my purpose. I robbed someone of an opportunity. Someone else deserved this, not me, I earned it but at what cost, I lost myself even further after it. She left and in her leaving she took my only chance of happiness. I love her from a distance, it pains me but I still love her. I’m sorry Eme I didn’t mean to hurt you. I told her I hope you find a man who will treat you as you deserve, not someone who doesn’t even know themselves, I hope they treat you better than I ever could. I Hope he does all the things I should have done. I told you they always leave but it isn’t your fault, I understood that from the day I met you to the day we split, you don’t need to remember me, just forget that I ever really was, truly I tell you I was a memory born to be forgotten. A grain of sand in the mighty ocean that is your life. Forget me I tell you, I hope I didn’t leave a sour taste in your mouth.

The way my parents raised me also makes me hard on myself as an adult when I make mistakes, even small ones. This leads me to feeling like I'm worth nothing, and things will never get better. I feel like things will never get better because they depend on me to do so. I don't feel like I can talk to anyone in my life about this, either, so I don't have a lot of support when I need it. My coping skills when I get into this place are almost non-existent. My counselor and others tell me to breathe deeply or challenge my harmful thoughts, but none of that feels like it helps. The thoughts and this feeling always stay with me. I don't know what would make my situation better. I don't know how to become a more stable person who can deal with making mistakes or feeling overwhelmed without getting to the point where I hate myself because of outside issues.

1jkinqr,mentalhealthsupport,2025-03-26 18:19:33,Why do I randomly want nothing to do with my mom?,"I (F32) have had a pretty up and down relationship with my mom majority of my life. It's always been hard for me to predict ""which mom"" I'm going to get. When she's great, she's great. But when she's not, she's really not. This would quickly turn into several novels if I fully went into our lore. But the main point is that she's inconsistent. And as a result, so is our relationship. 

About a week and a half ago I moved into my own apartment. After having been back living with her for quite a while. Due to a number of life circumstances. She helped me move in and unpacked majority of my stuff for me. Because it's all just been so emotionally taxing on me. I had no energy to do it myself (again, a novel's worth of an explanation to give the full picture of why I am so beyond burnt out). She stayed with me for the first 4 or 5 days. To continue helping me set my place up, get more things I needed (she spent over $600 just on things i still needed around my place 😳), and to just be there for emotional support. As change to my norm is not something I handle well. I wouldn't say the first night here alone was a complete breeze. But it didn't take too much longer for me to completely lean in to having my first bit of true alone time in a very very long time. 

What confuses me and I cannot make heads or tails of (this is far from being the first time this has happened) - is how I can go from NEEDING her around me at all times for days... to suddenly feeling like I want nothing to do with her. This time being especially confusing as she's been alarmingly comforting/supportive during the last couple weeks. Yet I somehow slipped into one of these... phases where even relieving a simple txt from her irritates me. Everything bothers me. Yet, simultaneously, on a subconscious level I feel so guilty for feeling that way. Because she has been SO good lately. Had she been awful to me then, sure, of course I wouldn't want to hear from her. Or be around her. And I can never seem to predict when these ""phases"" will happen. Or when they will end.

I went through an assessment a few months ago. Because I felt there were a great deal of things I was experiencing that didn't fit under the umbrella of what I was already diagnosed with. I already knew I have depression, generalized anxiety, and social anxiety. I was shocked to come out of that assessment with... the same diagnoses. No bipolar, no borderline personality disorder.. just depression and a lot of anxiety. However, this assessment unfortunately did not cover developmental issues such as autism and ADHD. Both of which I highly suspected that I have. 

So I don't know.. I don't know what this is, and I certainly don't know how to manage it. And I can't keep living with the guilt of how I imagine it must make my mom feel. And of course, it's not even something I can try to explain to her. Not just cause I don't even understand it myself. But how do you look your mother in the eye and tell her that sometimes you don't want anything to do with her??

1jipihf,mentalhealthsupport,2025-03-24 12:31:05,I don't know what to do,"I generally don't know what to do with my life.
I can't feel emotions or empathy, I'm just empty all the time. I don't want to do anything at all either, and the only reason for that is that I don't see the point. I'm just going to die one day so why does what I do in the meantime matter? I know I hate my family, and I don't have any friends, not that it changes anything. I don't have anyone to turn to, I'm truly alone. When I look to the future, I don't see the point in it. Why bother when you'll die and then be forgotten one day? I'm hopeless, and I don't know what to do to change it. No matter what I do I don't feel, I don't love and I don't care. What's the point in life if living itself can be so cruel?

I don't know nor do I understand what I am supposed to do in life. I was always called a genius kid or an old soul. But because of this, I was never told how to try, I was always comfortable with being the way I was. So much so that I never tried to improve, and look where that got me. I don't even know if there's anything I can do to feel better. I go to a therapist and have been for the past year, but all that's got me is online schooling and that isn't even helping. I feel like I just need to be locked away and forgotten, maybe that would be the best outcome.


I'm sorry if this was too much or too heavy of a subject but I really needed to get this off of my mind.

Do i still have a future?,"Fyi im 16 turning 17 and haven’t properly been to school for around 3 years, I don’t have a job and all i really do is sleep, vape eat and drink. My showering/self care situation is getting better than before during my lowest where I didn’t shower for a month or so. I have gone to different councillors and therapists. 

My parents encourage me to go to school but they kinda just gave up since they are pretty busy with their own things. 

My friends (idk what they are since i don’t really consider them friends just people i leech off of and provide things in return ) and classmates just ask where i am but iv never told them the answer because im afraid of judgement and being seen in a different way than i want to portray and the anxiety of facing everyone at school usually is why i wuss out in the mornings. I also get tired from talking to people since i dont want to be rude so i always pay attention to everyone and i have to remember what different people like and how they talk which really stresses my brain out. 

I have the very basic credits for my countries education system but im unsure what i want to do in the future, a lot of times i just think theres no point and want to kill myself but it seems like too much work and to be honest i am afraid. I wanted to pursue medical school and go on from there, but i got burnt out and started isolating myself again. I did special school that our government provides as long as i have a medical certificate. You can earn the same credits but I’m not sure if unis will accept me or if i would have to go to a technical uni instead of med. 

The reason I’m asking is because if I don’t kill myself I don’t want to be financially ruined. It’s one of my many fears.

1jco13s,mentalhealthsupport,2025-03-16 15:31:43,How do I get away from my toxic mum in the daytime?,"I'm so sick of her. All the time she's complaining about her life problems, swearing at me, shouting and calling me a disabled autistic whore and sometimes threatening to kill me. She doesn't teach me any life skills and doesn't know how to cook properly, but doesn't let me touch any cooking appliances. My family don't care and take her side. 

I can't tolerate being around her, but she's possessive and doesn't let me go anywhere by myself. She wouldn't even let me go in the garden by myself. She has been isolating me in the house and homeschooling me (she didn't teach me anything, so I did nothing all day) for almost two years. I'm 14 years old, 15 in 3 months. 

I know she has some sort of mental illness and she's in her own world on her phone, making videos and texting family (who don't care, but she still does it) about her life problems 24/7. She says things all the time without caring about the effect it has on people, she got a husband off a dating app and cheated on him not even a month later, and she even told him and laughed and joked about it. He's blind in one eye and she often makes jokes about it. 

She has made it clear and has said she doesn't give a fuck about my life, health, education, future, and my autism is too much work and I'm too much to deal with. She said many times that she wants to give me to my dad (he wants nothing to do with us and knows she's mentally ill, he's moved on with his life and has a new family.) 

I'm also dealing with the fact that I'm trans, and it's making it so hard to even leave my bed, talk in front of anyone, or look in a mirror without breaking down. I can't tolerate being perceived as someone I'm not, and I disassociate all the time. It's affecting my daily life and is all I think about, it's causing me depression, I can't do anything about it until I'm a legal adult because of her, but even then I have no social skills, no education, no life skills, no independence, and I don't know if going to be able to live on my own or even get a job.

I finally convinced her to put me back in a school, and I'm going tommorow to it. I'm going insane being stuck with her for so long and school will help get me away from her for a while, but I'm also afraid of being put in overwhelming situations and noisy, bright, crowded places. My mum of course doesn't care about my concerns and just wants to get rid of me, so I don't know what to do. 

What am I supposed to do? I can't tolerate being around her at all because of everything she constantly does, and I'm tired of being in tears every day from the hurtful things she says to me. I have nobody I can go to, and school might be an even worse environment for me because of my autism and sensory issues, and I'll still have the weekends with her.

I just want to get away from her. My older sister, who is an adult now, ran away from my mum when she was my age and went to a different city. If I go somewhere without her permission, she'll call the police and the entire family and start swearing and shouting at me nonstop. What do I do to get away from her in the daytime? 

Please don't tell me to call social services. I already talked to the NSPCC about everything and they referred me to get a social worker, but they aren't doing much and I've said all that I can to them, and I don't have proof or recordings of her. I don't have any storage on my phone to record and the audio is horrible quality.

1jbxoiv,mentalhealthsupport,2025-03-15 15:32:03,I have constant panic attacks when I'm alone.,"I'm gonna start by saying that I've been in and out of depressive episodes throughout all my teenhood, been on medication for it for a year, now off meds for about 6 months or so. I'm now in my early twenties, things got better, I am finally majoring in a field I'm okay with, I'm in my first ever relationship and my life took a good turn. I'd say I'm really grateful for my life as I have a lot of things going on, I go out a lot, have hobbies, lots of friends and I'm a pretty productive and very social person, no one would think that I can't stand being alone with my thoughts. While I've learned how to manage my sadness, I am now experiencing horrible panic attacks whenever I am alone, doesn't matter if it's a random tuesday afternoon or if it's 3am on a friday. I find myself constanly trying to keep my mind busy or being in the presence of other people to escape this huge stress I'm carrying everywhere with me. At first I thought it's a phase caused by external issues such as feeling overwhelmed by my tasks or my lack of productivity, but now that that's not the case anymore, I don't know why it keeps getting worse and worse. I can't stand it, I feel stuck, I can't breathe and all I wanna do is scream and run away somewhere, even though I don't have a place in mind. The thing is, I don't wanna escape my life, I like my life, but the second it goes quiet, my heart rate goes through the roof and I would do anything to stop the feeling. And while I do not know what caused this or how to control it, I've discovered there are some triggers: substance abuse, sex, violence, abandonment, lying, lack of control, it got to the point at which I can't even watch a movie if there's a short scene about these in it.

1j9naux,mentalhealthsupport,2025-03-12 15:56:33,Moving out/comfort zone struggle due to mental health,"Hello everyone, I need your help/advice. Sorry if it is long/confusing but English isn’t my native language.

So I (28F) live in a small town in a country in Europe. I grew up here, I always lived here. I never liked it, not the landscape, nor really the work/life balance etc. I have been thinking about moving for a while now, but for several (mostly economic reasons) I am still stuck here.
Now I am kinda at the point where either I move now or I make it work here, although I know that I don’t enjoy it. 

Here, I live in my small apartment at home, in the same building as my family but separate from them. Its nice, although not a place I see myself live in for more than some more years. I have a job offert here that might be interesting, but just compared to other jobs here, so not really something too exciting, just better than most alternatives. I have very few friends, not really any reasons to stay here other than comfort zone (although uncomfortable). I don’t enjoy my life, I just make it through the day. 

Now I kinda have an opportunity to move in a different country, where a good friend of mine lives. She offered me a job, although not a lot of hours/nor good pay. 
Thing is, its really hard to find an apartment in the area where she lives, and those that are available are very expensive. I don’t speak the language (yet) so thats also an issue, although most people speak English as a second language.

My problem is that my mental health isnt good at all, I keep thinking that I want to move, and when I start looking I get discouraged immediately, because of the difficulty in finding a place/moving, and most of all, because I don’t know if I would even like it there! I have been there twice on holiday and I really liked it, but if course thats different than moving there.
I know that probably its just laziness/fear of getting out of the comfort zone, but I dont find the energy to do so, because I know that I will have to settle for what I find in terms of job/apartment in the beginning. I would have to move with my 2 pets, which is also a big problem in terms of costs/logistics/finding a place, as well as losing my current apartment to my younger brother.

I think that my main issue is getting out into the comfort zone into the unknown scares me out more than it excites me! Anyone has been through something similar/has any tips on how to get out of the comfort zone?
Sorry for the rant, and if you made it here, thank you, any advice is highly appreciated!

1j99j31,mentalhealthsupport,2025-03-12 03:05:25,I need help. What is wrong with me??,"I haven't posted on Reddit before and I don't really know where to start with this or what to include. I know I should be seeking support from a therapist but I can't access one at the moment. but I'll start with the issue that has lead me to be make this post... 

I am 21 Female. living at home with my parents and younger brother. For a long time now I have struggled getting out of bed in the morning and leaving my room when I can hear people in the house. It gives me severe anxiety and as soon as I emerge my room I instantly try not to make eye contact, get agitated waiting for them to speak to me and then become deeply frustrated when they do. It's to the point where I don't get out of bed until the afternoon when I realise I am never going to get a chance to get out of bed with no one home and the whole day is nearly gone or I have to get up for work or I'll be late. So every day I walk past as quickly as possible, give a quick hi with my head down if they talk to me and speed walk into the bathroom where I sit in the bottom of the  shower for an hour trying to pull myself together and also try to figure out why I am like this.

 Some mornings I can't push past it especically when I'm forced to talk more than my usual ""hi"". I try to get ready as quickly as possible and strategicly as possible to not have to make eye contact or speak with anyone but this is quite a hard task as my house only has 5 rooms and my dad is often sitting in the  room located right outside my bedroom door so by the time I leave the house I'm an anxious mess. I don't know why I feel this way. I haven't always been like this. There are alot of ideas I've come up with that could be contributing factors but none that feel like enough of a reason to behave like this. I feel like a piece of shit. I don't want to treat my parents this way. Especially my dad who is kind to me and is only trying to say good morning. 

A one theory I have is it that I am becoming non verbal in the morning which is a common trait of autism (which I am not diagnosed with but am sure I have// my brother was diagnosed severely autistic as a child and is partially non verbal. He is 20 years old now and has learnt to say a few sentences that make sense mixed with alot of gibberish phrases.) 

Second theory is it may have developed over the past few years... Before my dog Lilly, a  16year old english Staffordshire passed away in January she was old and suffering from cancer. Her whole life my brother had pestered her by sitting on her, pulling her ears and tail, pinching her but she was the sweetest thing and never fought back. I tried to defend her as much as possible, especially as she got older and developed a cancerous lesion on her tail which my brother wouldn't stop touching with dirty hands and making it  infected. He also often has tantrums and would run into my room  while me and Lilly were asleep in bed and try to pinch her or hurt her in some way so I learnt to constantly listen to everything as I sleep and spring up to defend lilly instantly whenever I heard footsteps near my room or hear my door open. I wonder if the habit of this contributes to why I lay there anxiously listening but it would only explain fear of my brother. 

My mother has meltdowns herself occasionally but never tries to hurt me not did she try to hurt Lilly when she was alive. She lives in a van now and comes and goes when she likes but when I was a child and she lived in the house with us she would wake up every day and start yelling, throwing things around and slamming doors usually because there was mess she didn't like (toys on the floor, dishes not done, laundry) so alot of my childhood was spent walking in egg shells. My mum was an alcoholic and spent all of her time either at the pub, throwing up in the bathroom or yelling at us for the house not being the way she wanted. 

My dad is an amazing man. He did everything for me and my brother growing up and still continues to now. He cares for my brother full time and would do anything for me but I still feel this resentment towards him and I don't understand why. In the morning he is the person I avoid the most (possibly because he is the hardest to avoid?)and I don't understand why. Maybe it's because of his judgmental nature. Often criticizing people who aren't as mentally strong as him and need drugs and alcohol to cope, calling them selfish (I personally use weed to cope with all I've been through in life. I experienced some quite traumatic event in my early teens. I was groomed by a 21 year old crackhead who I ended up living with for a year at age 13 who abused me in countless ways) 
My dad also palms me off when I try to tell him I think I'm autistic or have other mental health issues which makes it really hard to connect with him emotionally. 

As much as I feel I have answered my own question here I still don't feel satisfied with my answers. I feel like I'm just whinging. Why do I feel these emotions. I know my life isn't that bad and my dad is such as amazing man. He's done so much for me and I can tell he's worried about me since I've been so closed off and often breaking down into tears as I'm leaving home. I don't understand why I struggle to talk to him lately. Whenever I am home I just have this feeling inside me like I'm going to explode out of my skin.

1j3qx49,mentalhealthsupport,2025-03-05 01:02:28,Need some advice. CW SH,"CW: mention of S.H

Sorry to the mods if you remove this. I understand :)

I am 19.
I don’t have any diagnosed conditions and I am not seeking one. This is more of a vent than asking for help.

When I was 15, I didn’t have friends, not real ones, I was in the process of coming out as transgender, and in the middle of lockdown. I was, as you can imagine, very hormonal, very angsty and sad. I wasn’t bullied, just very insecure and unhappy. I decided that S H was the way to go. I wasn’t suicidal, I didn’t want to die, I just didn’t want to be sad anymore. I did this for around a year. In 30c weather (heatwave in the UK), I would be wearing black hoodies and black jeans. I struggled but made it through, playing it off that it was because I was trans and didn’t want to see my chest so much, which was very true but not the reason.
Eventually, I stopped. I waited for my scars to heal before I told my parents what I had been doing and they were very understanding.

It had been 4 years since I’d done so.

Had.

I don’t mean to sound like I’m bragging or proud of that because I’m really disappointed in myself. 4 years. I was okay for 4 years. I coped for 4 years. And now it’s all gone. Can I just not count this instance? It was a one time slip up.

I don’t understand why I did it. I’m not depressed, just having a hard time. I am having a bad time at work, finding the motivation to actually do what I’m supposed to when I’m there. I get to work fine, and I’m happy but I just can’t actually do what I need to do, I just stand around waiting for things to just happen themselves I guess. People at work re starting to hate me because I’m lazy. They constantly whisper like I’m not even there. I’m searching for a new job but I just keep getting rejection emails, even with 2 years experience. The other day, I handed my notice in to my boss, gave myself a month to find new work. He called me into the office to talk, and I just cried. I wasn’t going to cry, I was going to be angry and yell about all the problems at work, like I said in my letter. But, my boss. He is an excellent man, he just told me to think bout it, listened to what I could actually say and told me he would be checking up on me. Asked if there was anything else going on that’s not work related. I told him that it’s just everything, I couldn’t think/say anything specific. I mean, I have had 6 months of 3pm-10pm shifts. And there is no end in site. I haven’t had more than a week off all together since November, which doesn’t sound like that long but before that, I’d saved my holiday hours from the entire year for 4 weeks off paid. I had surgery abroad and needed recovery time. I didn’t want to come back but I needed money because even now, I still owe £2500 for my surgery. 
I think part of why I am so unhappy at work isn’t excactly because of work. I come home and it’s not much better. Our house is now more mould and damp than actual house. My bedroom currently has a leak in the roof, which has now allowed for fucking mushrooms to grow up there. Mushrooms. And I can’t afford to do anything about it. I’ve tried clearing out the mould as much as possible, I’ve tried wiping down every surface, I have a dehumidifier going 24/7 but nothing helps. I’ve given up on it. I gave up a while ago actually. I don’t bother cleaning up because even if I do, it looks horrible still. The other day, I had to throw things in my own way, so I’d be motivated to clean up. Even then I only cleaned up the stuff on the floor. 
I haven’t showered in 3 days, haven’t brushed my teeth in over a week. And I just fucked up after 4 years.


I should go to a doctor, seek out a diagnosis, but part of me is saying that medically, there is nothing wrong with me, that I’m just being lazy, and I’m happy a lot of the time, so I can’t have anything wrong with me. But most of the time, I’m only really happy when I’m around other people. Most of the time I don’t really feel anything. I don’t really feel sad, just… a bit like this 🫤 not sad, not happy. Just…I exist.

1jmaiz5,mentalhealthsupport,2025-03-29 00:52:44,Perfectionism is ruining my life!!!,"
Hey everyone,

I wanted to share something personal I’ve been struggling with lately and would love some advice. I’ve always been someone who strives to do things perfectly, whether it’s school, work, or even personal projects. While this might seem like a good thing at first, I’ve noticed it has started to impact my mental health and daily life.

For example, when I start a new task, I spend so much time planning and trying to get everything perfect from the beginning that it ends up delaying progress or even stopping me from finishing things. I constantly feel like what I do isn’t good enough, and this mindset has led me to put off things I know I should be doing.

The worst part is that it makes me doubt myself constantly, even when I do achieve something. I’ve been trying to let go of this pressure I put on myself, but it’s tough. I’m afraid of making mistakes and failing, and I get frustrated when things don’t turn out exactly how I envisioned them.

Has anyone here struggled with perfectionism? How do you manage it and stop it from holding you back? Any advice on how to accept imperfections and not let them control my life would be really helpful!

Thanks in advance for reading this, and I look forward to hearing your thoughts!",1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/MentalHealthSupport/comments/1jmaiz5/perfectionism_is_ruining_my_life/,Perfectionism ruining life Hey everyone wanted share something personal Ive struggling lately would love advice Ive always someone strives things perfectly whether school work even personal projects might seem like good thing first Ive noticed started impact mental health daily life example start new task spend much time planning trying get everything perfect beginning ends delaying progress even stopping finishing things constantly feel like isnt good enough mindset led put things know worst part makes doubt constantly even achieve something Ive trying let go pressure put tough Im afraid making mistakes failing get frustrated things dont turn exactly envisioned anyone struggled perfectionism manage stop holding back advice accept imperfections let control life would really helpful Thanks advance reading look forward hearing thoughts
1jm4wzi,mentalhealthsupport,2025-03-28 20:34:20,No News is Good News,"I'm cracking under the pressure. Tiny things are tipping me over to being emotional. I'm on my monthly, but this week just has hit me so freaking hard. I'm trying to recover. I feel lonely and bored. I want to find my happiness again, but nothing ever lines up. 

At work, I'm always the exception as someone has to cover the front desk. So I have to wait to get my break until my coworker can come. And she's not doing it on purpose, she's stuck in a work call. But I'm waiting. I could go get someone else, but no one really wants the front desk and I guess I'm just rather wait for her than get questioned by those outside of my department. When there's a schedule change, it's ""you have to agree with her on what days you can take off."" And I just feel like I'm always asking for favors, but no one is ever asking me for favors. So I end up feeling like a begger. They are supposed to be changing things around but the manager hasn't looked into into a new phone system. Half of my coworkers work from home, and I'm only allowed 2 days compared to my cover, whose allowed the entire week. I guess makes sense I'm the receptionist, but I never wanted to be the only receptionist, they always made it sound like there was going to be 3 of us, but now it's just me and the former receptionist and a payroll clerk. And I have to figure out my breaks and lunches between them or my days off. 

I ask for more work, the manager asks the team, but I never get more work. So I'm doing this monthly task and since I'm the only one, it demotivates me as I'm trying to ration out how much I will do each day to leave me something. And I guess I hope they will notice that I'm not doing everything and get another person to come help me. I know this sounds weird, but as I'm asking for more work but then leaving work undone until the deadline. But otherwise I don't have anything else. 

I feel distant with my friends and family. Grandma in the hospital. Brother dropped out of high school this week. He's depressed. Trying to make me and him not depressed anymore. 

I only see my husband for 2 hours a day, which is when we eat and cook. So I can't plan anything after work to met with friends. It seems too late to go out at 8pm. Not many options and my friends go to bed early. So now I'm bothered that I can't go do friend stuff because of my husband. But then I'm bothered I can't see my husband because of the work schedule. 

Then money has been a pinched. I used my IRA to cover my credit card. But that is just one out of 3. There's always something. And not enough for something else. We get by. We go on dates (ie a movie and take out ever 2 weeks, nothing grand, just something to get me out of the house). But then we have to delay haircuts or car repairs or medical checkups. 

I don't have any passions to do at home. I'm bored. I default to crafts but there's no joy. I call my husband but there's no fun conversations just ""we need to buy this"" ""with what money????"" 

I know it's me. I'm going to therapy next week. I only have 2 hours left. But I'm cracking right now.

Hoping to pick brains here and get advice on how to help her. Specifically if there are any mental health resources for adults who are out of work.

Currently she is not working (has not even applied to one job since getting laid off) does not attend social activities, lives with family member who pays the bills. She seems to have no motivation to move forward and I cant tell if maybe it’s fueled by depression, anxiety, or a combo, or something all together different. I feel she probably has a lot weighing her down that she has not worked through and my main goal is to get help for her. I cannot financially take it on. Our parents wont either. Does anyone have any advice in terms of resources that I could potentially lead her to?",1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/MentalHealthSupport/comments/1jm1j44/advice_dealing_with_an_unmotivated_adult_sister/,Advice Dealing Unmotivated Adult Sister Im sure right forum Ive done lot googling cant figure rootwhat issues may plaguing family member Hoping pick brains get advice help Specifically mental health resources adults work sister 46F work 4 years laid first jobonly job 16 years Currently working even applied one job since getting laid attend social activities lives family member pays bills seems motivation move forward cant tell maybe fueled depression anxiety combo something together different feel probably lot weighing worked main goal get help financially take parents wont either anyone advice terms resources could potentially lead
1jlx68e,mentalhealthsupport,2025-03-28 15:04:25,15m stb 16m idiotic dad,"Sorry if this text is clunky and hard to undsrstand, im really upset while typing this

Already at the age of 4 I was hit by both my parents. Long story short they ""were"" stupid and is ""trying"" to make thinks better. The last time my dad hardcore assaulted me was when I was 12-13.

I've was suicidal from 10 to a while ago. I stopped being suicidal because in a few months I have a chance to move out to my grandparents to study in university. I want to be able to make to be successful despite of my upbringing and be able to insult them before I'm able to completely cut ties with them. My mom warned and manipulated me to now tell anyone how they treated me. The reasons why I still haven't reported them is because they put up with my abnormal sleeping habits and lets me be, and I have alot of chronic dieses but my dad disturbs me if I dont respect his authority or whatever that guy does in need for validation.

He just barged into my room and screamed at me because I didn't wanna talk to him and hung up the phone abruptly. I'm not upset that he was yelling at me but because I have to put up with this until next semester. He yelled I wasn't raised well (insult in my home language) as if that was someone else's job, I yelled at him he didn't raise me at all and just hit me at the age of 4.

I said at that age I don't know any better and he replied ""at that age you know lots"" like what???
I'm pretty sure I developed autism because of how my parents raised me. He got mad because ""that was in the past"" and ""i should stop mentioning it"", he's a pig for trying to block out his past. He's claimed in the past that he wants to make us work but I just absolutely resent him and cannot forget that he did.

Also, if I were to report him for crimes like way later for child abuse would that still be possible to get him punished? Like when I'm an adult around 26-30",1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/MentalHealthSupport/comments/1jlx68e/15m_stb_16m_idiotic_dad/,15m stb 16m idiotic dad Sorry text clunky hard undsrstand im really upset typing Already age 4 hit parents Long story short stupid trying make thinks better last time dad hardcore assaulted 1213 Ive suicidal 10 ago stopped suicidal months chance move grandparents study university want able make successful despite upbringing able insult Im able completely cut ties mom warned manipulated tell anyone treated reasons still havent reported put abnormal sleeping habits lets alot chronic dieses dad disturbs dont respect authority whatever guy need validation barged room screamed didnt wan na talk hung phone abruptly Im upset yelling put next semester yelled wasnt raised well insult home language someone elses job yelled didnt raise hit age 4 said age dont know better replied age know lots like Im pretty sure developed autism parents raised got mad past stop mentioning hes pig trying block past Hes claimed past wants make us work absolutely resent forget Also report crimes like way later child abuse would still possible get punished Like Im adult around 2630

1jlqedg,mentalhealthsupport,2025-03-28 08:31:38,Is my need to be perfect what is causing so much pain?,"I (M 19) have essentially been held to the highest standard my entire life. My family has always said that the most important thing is grades and academics, to the point of keeping me out of sports and extracurricular activity so I could focus on my studies. I was always harshly punished for falling short of grades (anything below a 90% was considered failure in my household) and was always told that I would be great. This has been a constant in my life as long as I could remember, this idea that I would one day be someone who goes down in history. I kid you not I once told my parents I was only 18 and I was doing pretty good compared to most and was told “Alexander was 18 when he was toppling nations” (which isn’t true by the way) “you don’t have an excuse” This idea was reinforced when I got into the gifted program at my school at a young age where, I was never directly told, but it was heavily implied that I was “going places” and I was destined for more than my classmates. 
This was all fine and dandy until I got to college, where, egged on my parents because of the future career benefits, I decided to join Greek life, something that I was always told would help my to achieve my dreams. This posed a couple of issues because, 1, I was a nerd who had never been allowed to play sports and didn’t have any social skills, and 2, I had learned that the only way to be good enough was by being the best. The fraternity i joined is well regarded and fairly large, but not the best on my campus, something that makes me feel awful regularly. I quickly began to realize that I wasn’t the smartest anymore, not only this but the people around me were better looking and more confident than I could ever be. This was around the time that, for the first time in my life, in my freshman year of college, I got a C in a class, I need to emphasize how devastating this was for me, at this point I had never studied, didn’t pay attention and had been thought that i wouldn’t have to because I was me. My parents immediately cut my financial support, leading to the need for me to get a full time job on top of everything.
My life feels like it’s falling apart, and I don’t know why. Whenever I confide in someone about my deep insecurities, they are often surprised because from the outside, I’m doing quite well, I have decent grades, I’m fairly attractive (though I can’t see it), I’ve made great strides in social development, and everyone seems to love me. But for some reason I berate myself for being constantly inadequate, because I can’t measure up to everyone around me, I’m not the best at anything, I’m average and it’s the closest feeling to physical pain I can explain. Since this feeling started I’ve seen mental health professionals and been diagnosed with ADHD, anxiety, depression, and narcissistic tendencies. I want to get out of this rut and am open to any advice people might be able to offer.",1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/MentalHealthSupport/comments/1jlqedg/is_my_need_to_be_perfect_what_is_causing_so_much/,need perfect causing much pain 19 essentially held highest standard entire life family always said important thing grades academics point keeping sports extracurricular activity could focus studies always harshly punished falling short grades anything 90 considered failure household always told would great constant life long could remember idea would one day someone goes history kid told parents 18 pretty good compared told Alexander 18 toppling nations isnt true way dont excuse idea reinforced got gifted program school young age never directly told heavily implied going places destined classmates fine dandy got college egged parents future career benefits decided join Greek life something always told would help achieve dreams posed couple issues 1 nerd never allowed play sports didnt social skills 2 learned way good enough best fraternity joined well regarded fairly large best campus something makes feel awful regularly quickly began realize wasnt smartest anymore people around better looking confident could ever around time first time life freshman year college got C class need emphasize devastating point never studied didnt pay attention thought wouldnt parents immediately cut financial support leading need get full time job top everything life feels like falling apart dont know Whenever confide someone deep insecurities often surprised outside Im quite well decent grades Im fairly attractive though cant see Ive made great strides social development everyone seems love reason berate constantly inadequate cant measure everyone around Im best anything Im average closest feeling physical pain explain Since feeling started Ive seen mental health professionals diagnosed ADHD anxiety depression narcissistic tendencies want get rut open advice people might able offer
1jlnj1n,mentalhealthsupport,2025-03-28 05:02:16,[Vent] About being employed and life in general,"I'm male-presenting, 23, and live at home. My home life is terrible; just cut and dry terrible, and I despise most of my family for either being racist, homophobic, stupid, entitled, narcissistic- or for in general just having ruined each others lives. I *was* employed basically as soon as I came out of college, and due to my mental health I really struggled to keep that job; sleeping-in past the start of my shift, not being able to force the happy-go-lucky energy needed for it- and though these things weren't a good look, the owner was thankfully pretty lenient about it all, as I'd been training there for, like, 15 years before working there. For context, my first job was as a Kickboxing Instructor; I was grandfathered into the role because taking a job there was part of the training once you hit 3rd Dan.

But for reasons I can't explain, and can only blame myself for (when realistically I know there were a thousand other issues with that place before I got the position I did), once I was a full time instructor- attendance started dropping and eventually they couldn't afford to pay me a wage anymore. That, and the building manager doubled the cost of their unit. I stopped going after that, because it just felt awkward- and after having trained there for so many years I was just really tired of it all.

That, and the attitude they gave me surrounding the disability they also technically gave me, really put me off of them as people. During a day of training I was flipped onto the mats and trapped my sciatic nerve in my back muscles, crushing it. Went to physio and they were able to get my muscles to release it, but it's been permanently crippled. I now have pain in my back, and legs, and sometimes everywhere else- which I will have for the rest of my life- and performing any form of manual labour makes it worse.

They refused to let me take a walking stick with me onto the mats to teach with, despite me being sensible with it and never using or holding it inappropriately. I needed and still need it to support my legs whenever my pain is bad, which again is caused by great amounts of physical activity. They somehow thought that I would be able to teach better if I didn't have it? As if removing it from my person would magically make me able to still teach to the level I used to teach at, before I fucked up my body? After it'd happened, I'd been trying to adapt my teaching style to be less active, and more observant and guiding, but that wasn't *their* style apparently.

Anyway, so guess whose second job was legitimately purely manual labour! I worked in a warehouse as a picker and packer, where I was forced to load and unload heavy boxes of random shit day in and day out for two months- before I nearly walked in front of a fork lift because the days had started to blend together so badly, I felt as if I had never actually left the warehouse at the end of the day. That, and I was yelled at about not being able to move as fast as everyone else on the hot glue assembly line, after having gotten said hot glue on my fucking hand, while my muscles were seizing from the nerve pain. This, by a manager who I had told three times by that point, that I was disabled- and needed to be put on the slower tasks if they wanted things to go smoothly. I despise people with a passion; having to interact with other people that aren't a part of my immediate friend group is tiring, unfulfilling, grating and downright anxiety-induced agony. It all just feels so fake.

It was ultimately the bleach truck that made me leave that position though. One of the jobs is to just unload unventilated lorries containing mountains of bleach products. They give you a P90 mask and goggles, and neither are enough.

You might wonder why *that* was my next place of employment though, considering I'd been to both college and University! Well, that was because I got my degree in Film and Television Production. Because I'm a fucking idiot. I'd assumed I was going to be with the Kickboxing Academy forever, and despite my disagreement with how things were run, as well as my overall mental health- it was the one job I've had so far that I could tolerate. It was also a 3 minute walk from my house, so if I overslept I could sprint there and be on time for my shift.

I was not with them forever, however. I'd chosen to do the stupid thing of getting a degree in one of my passions, instead of something that would actually make me money- because I'd hoped that I'd never have to *use* my degree. It is worth noting here however, that I wasn't even necessarily passionate about Film and TV Production either- it was just one of two choices put before me when going to college that elicited any form of reaction out of my soul, that had remained unimpressed, uncaring and acted ignorant to every other choice put before it as an option.

The last wall I have in my defense against swallowing pills or walking out into traffic, is that I have never turned my passion into my job. There is one- *one-* job that I *know* I would be happy, and capable, of doing. If I had to wake up every morning and my job was *video editor* for *anyone* other than myself, I'd kill myself. I feel the need to curl my whole body around this little corner of enjoyment I have managed to somehow find, and if the rest of the outside world ever touches it the agony I would feel and the desolate emptiness that would carve out the place where my heart should be, would disqualify me from ever feeling a spark of passion again. 

Since leaving the warehouse, I have applied for one-hundred and twenty-two jobs, ranging from data entry, to sports coach, to cctv operator- to all other mad, cockamamie positions that I couldn't give less shits about. Of those one-hundred and twenty-two positions, I have had an interview with two. Just two. And one of the companies told me to show up, after they knew it was £500 for me to travel there for the weekend to work and then go home, only to ghost me and force me to find out from the person they'd hired, that someone else got the job.

The other was a Psychic Hotline, that earns me less in a month when you do the math, than I get on Universal Credit.

The bastards that have the *audacity* to tell me I'm not trying hard enough! To accuse me of scheming and plotting to stay on Universal Credit, instead of getting a fucking job- when they can see how many fucking jobs I've applied for- because they require you to document every fucking job that you do! My work coach told me to my face that she thought there was something suspicious about me being on Universal Credit for so long because I'm so well educated- and had the audacity to claim I wasn't looking for positions hard enough!

You know what she listed as evidence? That fact that I hadn't applied for SENIOR fucking positions, using my degree that is both UNDER-QUALIFIED for the position- and that I HAVEN'T USED TO WORK IN THE INDUSTRY EVER-!

How fucking stupid do you have to be; how fucking deplorable, and fitly and rotten do you have to be-?!

The anger I feel when typing all of this out burns so fucking hot in my chest; I feel like I could scream for the rest of my life; until my throat was ripped, and raw- and I still would not be able to give the rage and hatred and bile enough of a voice.

They don't even pay you enough to live off of. Why the fuck would I want to stay on £300 a month, when that barely covers fucking food unless you're tactical, and scrimp, and save every last fucking penny.

Yes, work coach, there *is* something I'm not telling you. It's that every fucking job I have ever worked; freelance or contract, makes me want to kill myself. The idea, the reality, of waking up every morning in the cold; tired, to march to an office, or drive to a warehouse- to spend 8, 9, 10 hours every day of my life, for the rest of my life- slaving away on useless, mind-numbing, unimportant tasks- makes me want to kill myself. I was able to last *two months* before my mind melted and I nearly fucking committed; after so many fucking years of just hoping and praying something would finally kill me, or I would have the fucking guts to kill myself, all it took was *two months* as a wage-slave for my brain to decide it was time!

The thought *alone* makes me so fucking sick that I don't want to live, the reality I just *can't handle*. I haven't self-harmed in years now, and I still don't feel the urge. Instead I feel like a scared, trapped rat pressed against the corner of my enclosure; my heart beating a million miles a second as I wait for an invisible predator to gore me.

We get *so little* time on this Earth to just *live,* and you're telling me I have to spend *two-thirds* of it *earning my right to stay alive?!* FUCK THAT-! There's not enough wonders in this WORLD let alone this UNIVERSE to warrant that kind of deal. I have *seen* what this fucking world has to offer, and I am not impressed. You have taken the actual, legitimate miracle that is life, and twisted it into something *not worth experiencing*. I've seen everything I wanna see. I want off this fucking ride already.

I live in *filth* surrounded by *filth*, where I am forced to reckon with the fact that I very soon will be forced to stay with whatever job I next get, or else my fucking family won't be able to afford to live. That's not fucking fair!

For context, my partner is moving over to the UK by the end of the year, and because the UK is a shit-hole, we'll both need to work in order to afford rent. I've been living at home since I became unemployed; my mum being good for legitimately this one thing and nothing else- which is a whole other can of worms that I want to choke me to death. But soon, I will need to get a job- but I know I can't *handle* getting a job, and it feels like I can *see the guillotine dangling above my neck!*

I just want to create; I just want to exist; I just want to be able to eat, and sleep and be warm, and create- and that's it! Why the fuck do I have to *work* to earn my right to be *alive.*

Also, ha! 'I just need to get a job', as if I haven't taken the first fucking thing I've been able too every god-damn-time it's arrived. You wanna know why the only two places I've worked after the Dojo were at a warehouse, and a psychic hotline? Because they're the only fucking places that said YES!

There is something so fundamentally *wrong* with me and I don't know what it is; I sleep and eat at my desk in my chair; I live surrounded by trashbags because somehow the bins are *always* full- and my mother and brother never actually clean the fucking house (I always clean my area, I just don't take the bags out sometimes for a few weeks); I fantasize constantly about such *fucked up things* that I don't even want to mention because they're that bad; I've just been desensitized to them; I go through trackable phases where I just *can't sleep* no matter how tired I get and it completely fucks up my ability to retain time; the only friends I have live in another country and I might not get to live with them for *five more years*\-!

My ability to spell and read has also been significantly degrading too for the past several years. Sometimes, I'll be typing and I'll just spell a completely different word? Or press the key to a completely different letter- or spell basic fucking words wrong and not know how to spell them. That seems... less important compared to everything else, but it's something that's been upsetting me.

I feel like the few friends I do have are constantly one bad interaction away from leaving me, even when I know for certain they never will- to the point where it sends me into fits of manic depression whenever one of them doesn't respond to a message I send them- which just makes me feel worse because- why the fuck am I like this?

The point of this post was supposed to be me complaining about not being able to tolerate being employed, but it kind of devolved towards the end so I'm probably just going to mark this as a vent. 

I am being serious though when I ask what's wrong with me. If you're, like, a medical professional or something- I ask you to try and point me in the direction of *anything* that would explain why I'm like this because I just want to know. That's it at the end of the day. If I can put a name to what is wrong with me, I think it'd make me feel more secure in knowing I'm not just a pathetic, idiotic loser who can't handle life.

1jlia5t,mentalhealthsupport,2025-03-28 00:23:10,I’m so confused,"Almost 10 years ago I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety. 

When I was a kid my school said I had ADHD. But no medical professional confirmed.

About 7 years ago I was diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder. 

And just recently i was diagnosed with PTSD.

Add to that, that I was always over sensitive to noises and now get mad if I feel ‘overwhelmed’ by music, or something in the background like the lights buzzing… 

I’m just kinda lost. I have all these labels being thrown at me and I don’t know if any or all and more are right. 

I am a female, so I hear lots about woken not getting diagnosed properly when younger? 

It’s gotten particularly overwhelming for me as I have very low energy and focus issues. I like to listen to YouTube videos or audio books, to help me zone out and focus, but then I hit a certain point where even that overwhelms me and I want to cry. 

I even get anxiety attacks about watching a new episode of a show I’m going through, because I don’t know what to expect. I only want to watch stuff I’ve already seen if I feel like that. 

It really does make me feel super messed up and like all these hopelessness and helplessness I feel. Add to it I lost my job and am physically disabled and I just feel like a burden.

It is paralyzing. I just don’t feel like I have it in me to do much of anything, and if I ‘push through’ I feel completely spent. Like I got nothing left and need to sleep. Today I wasn’t even up to pouring a bowl of cereal. It literally felt like too much work. 

I guess I wanted to post this to see if anyone relates? (Which a part of me hopes you don’t because I wouldn’t wish this on anyone), but also so I don’t feel insane. Battling this invisible enemy no one else sees, you know? 

Sorry for the length, I’d do a TLDR, but wouldn’t know how to summarize it.

Thanks to those who read this and I hope I followed the rules. Sorry if I didn’t.

Thanks

1jlf344,mentalhealthsupport,2025-03-27 22:01:28,I did it and still doing it,"Ive got to say from being sooo over weight , homelessness survived abusive households ect 

Ive finally got my own place after 4 months i finally have an actual bed to sleep on as well as a fridge and cooker!

Ngl ive almost given up on myself a few times and almost said bugger it (not sure if I can swear lol)

I used to be soo lazy and miserable but since I have focused on being happy and being around happy people this train of thought has really changed my life and perspective!

When I focus on happiness it just gives off a good vibe and from being someone who has severe social anxiety to the point I never left my home. Never wanted to speak to anyone new or make any friends and was isolated. Now due to this train of thought and caring a little less about what others think as well as finally being able to experience peace!  Im the happiest I’ve ever been!

I hope this isn’t my high point in life im gonna try my best to continue this focus because omg mentality is an incredible and hard thing to do but it’s never impossible ! 

Ive never ever been proud of myself or felt like I’m going anywhere in life but at this  exact moment in time i am!

I wake up from disturbing mental  flashes as I'm falling asleep and twice now I've woken up in a completely different place than I fell asleep. 

Could this be a mental health issue. I have been diagnosed as manic depressive bipolar and was wondering if it's related to that.

I don't have anywhere else to go so I'm going to try this. I've been struggling a lot recently with self hatred and depression. It has gotten to the point that I have a plan ready to die I'm just waiting for the right time. I just don't see much hope in the future. I feel like such a burden to everyone around me. People always tell me that people would be upset and yeah sure they might be, but they'd be better off without me. 

School, work, and social life have just gotten too much. I see no point in continuing school as I feel like I'll never amount to anything. I'm stuck at a job that no one cares about and that could be easily replaced. Finally, I don't have a social life. I upset all of my friends and my boyfriend could do so much better than me. 

Giving up just seems so easy and it seems like the right decision.

1jl4s2b,mentalhealthsupport,2025-03-27 14:10:12,dealing with OCD and depression,"Good Morning, 

I guess I am here just looking for support from others that struggle. I have been OCD since I was in 8th grade. I have also had anxiety most of my life. I have had two really rough bouts of depression, one when my son was born and the one I am in now. Just to make a long story short, it all started about 2.5 years ago when I switched job. I was a principal at a middle school and I decided to move to my districts alternative school. I knew it was bad, but I had confidence that I could change it. When I got there it was really rough. I immediately did not like it but I was stuck. While I was there my first year my sister in law took her own life and then a close friend of mine did the same. At the end of the year my son went off to college and I was not prepared for that either. I started to really get down. I have been getting help since it all started. I ended up stepping down from the principal job back to an assistant principal which I did not want to do, but I didn't have a choice. When I have experienced depression it would come and go, now it seems like its here to stay and I get so exhausted dealing with it. I know tons of people deal with it, but it just feels like Im alone. I talk to my wife and mom and I feel like it is wearing them down. I just do not want to deal with this forever. I am on medicine and doing all I know to work to get better. I just feel stuck in this cycle of ups and downs. Primarily downs. Any suggestions or encouragement is welcome.

(Since 3rd grade)  And now that I’m in 8th grade, I’ve gotten so attached to my teacher. I’ve written a letter to her addressing that I need someone to just listen to my problems, (I’ve relapsed - cutting) I don’t need help right now in anyway, just an ear to listen. But I’m scared of how she’ll react, what if she tells the office or the school councillor? I’m really not comfortable with talking about it with anyone else but her, esp my school councillor cause she makes me uncomfortable. I’ve talked to 2 of my friends about it, at first they thought it was a good idea, but then one friend said that I shouldn’t do it. As it’s not part of my teacher’s job to really deal with this kind of stuff. I really don’t want to make my teacher uncomfortable. But if I tell her, I’ll get a sense of closure, sure I told two friends about my situation, but I feel like they aren’t understanding my situation as much as I think my teacher would. Please help me, I’m torn between giving her the letter or just let it be. My teacher’s also going for a trip, I don’t want her to think about it during her trip but I really need help.

During my 21 years of living, I do have problems but I never once experienced being depressed about it, I smile and I know I can get through with it.

For the last 3 months, I’ve been this very sensitive and emotional motherfucker, I cry all the time for god knows what. I’m damn sad all the time it’s stressing me out, I don’t know why. I figured my stressors would be my school but it really isn’t because my academics are doing well, I have a mom who listens to me yap. In all honesty, I’m well aware that I’m lucky to have a support system, but I don’t know where this sadness came from i’ve been like this for 3 months already, I’m becoming toxic to my bf. I just feel so sad, unwanted and unloved for whatever the fuck’s reason on my head. Is it possible for a mentally stable person to be mentally unstable in a short span of time?

1jl2ltg,mentalhealthsupport,2025-03-27 12:20:59,r/mental health,"Hello all, 

I wanted some advice on how to deal with a difficult situation at work. I have a younger colleague whom I'm currently struggling to work with. We're both engineers but I'm more on the project management side and she's a developer. I noticed whenever our conversations get technical and I ask her some questions in areas that are not clear for me, for example : ""hey, I am not sure I understood what you meant here in the document, what does x and y mean?"" 
She responds always in a very defensive, confrontational and condescending tone.

This in turn makes me feel very anxious, scared, my heart beats very fast my hands shake and I'm unable to think. I just want to cry in that moment out of fear. 
I want to make her aware of this but I'm concerned she'll gaslight me and make me the problem and make my life more difficult.

The issue is she and I have been talking to eachother about the struggles in the company and she complains about the company everyday to me and she's resigning in 6 months. But it's exhausting her constant complaining. 
I'm afraid to open up to her because she might also say I don't have evidence of this behavior or she might spread rumors about me to her support coworkers and might hurt my job. She cannot be trusted as she's crazy.

1jl2dpr,mentalhealthsupport,2025-03-27 12:08:22,How to cope?,"March has probably been the toughest month for me this year. I got removed as a friend with no explanation at all, quit my job due to my deteriorating mental health and can’t even find the motivation to study for uni. To top it off the person I thought who was truly my friend left me so alone during a time period I needed someone so badly to speak to and hangs out with the other person who stopped being friends with me and told me point blank to go get “clinical help” as if I should go and admit myself into a psych ward. 
I constantly think to myself am I really that bad of a person? I know we all have flaws and I have genuinely apologised and regretted things I’ve done in the past that people still keep bringing up to this day. 
I’m tired of it all and I feel so lonely, I sleep to try to not let my mind wander into overthinking and it feels so suffocating because I just want to talk to someone who can show me compassion for what I’m going through. I’ve always been the one to be there for others but when it comes to me I’m shoved to the side and left to deal with my emotions by myself.

1jl1ue9,mentalhealthsupport,2025-03-27 11:37:37,I feel like a burden when i want to open up to people,"Currently 17 (year 12), when i was young (grade 7-10) i had mad anxiety and depression and i was stressed about school and everything going on. I opened up to my mum about it (first time telling anyone i was struggling) and she was fine in the moment like i felt relieved and it was great. But about a week or so later she saw me not studying or something and said something along the lines of “dont come crying to me when… (idk)” but what stuck was her saying dont come crying to me after my most vulnerable moment and that lowkey fucked me up a bit because i was at the lowest time in my life when i talked to her, and she used it against me. 

I think this might be where my problems with expressing emotion stems from because i always have this fear if i ever want to talk to someone telling me that my problems are invalid, or that im troubling them with my emotions, or that they might use it against me (these 3 are the main ones that come to mind) 

Ive also been put under a lot of pressure from my parents and i constantly feel like im not good enough.


What should i do?
